I now have a job that is [fulfilling in creative ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4Wy7gRGgeA) and a reasonable work-life balance.  My improv is progressing ([Game Face](https://www.facebook.com/gamefacelondon) are performing twice this week).  I have cats!

What now?  I&#8217;ve been reading and have realised that my PhD left me with a really high tolerance for dense, unreadable prose &#8211; so reading textbooks for fun is now a thing that can possibly happen.  I have recently read

  * [Release it!](https://pragprog.com/book/mnee/release-it)
  * [Mature Optimisation](http://carlos.bueno.org/optimization/mature-optimization.pdf)
  * [Kellogg on Marketing (SE)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Alice_M_Tybout_Kellogg_on_Marketing?id=d1nR2NghcbgC) (recommended by [Jed Rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jed_Rose))

and at the top of my reading stack is [Improvise: Scene from the Inside Out](http://www.shop.annoyanceproductions.com/Improvise-Scene-from-the-Inside-Out-001.htm) recommended by [Paul Foxcroft](https://twitter.com/misterspidergod).  I&#8217;m proud to be part of Game Face and I want to share our work with a wide audience &#8211; and currently that means upskilling to find out how to help that in coming about.

Here are some sentences, none of which are from the above textbooks:

&#8220;On the one hand [education wants to be free](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free), because when you teach someone something they can teach it to someone else.  On the other hand education wants to be expensive, because teachers have a miserable time of it.&#8221;

&#8220;When I was born the sun turned blood red for a day.&#8221;

&#8220;The Internet is a series of pipes.&#8221;

&#8220;We&#8217;re surfing on the Information Superhighway, and I feel fine.&#8221;
