I&#8217;ve been reading [The Codeless Code](http://thecodelesscode.com/contents), a collection of software koans named after The Gateless Gate with lovely illustrations and commentaries and poems which are very fun to read &#8211; I&#8217;ve also been reading the [Collection of Stone and Sand](http://www.ashidakim.com/zenkoans/zenindex.html), a collection of Zen koans.  Here is [a well-known koan](http://www.ibiblio.org/zen/gateless-gate/18.html), redecorated to be about improv.

(The Codeless Code has a section dedicated to [cultural appropriation and authenticity](http://thecodelesscode.com/about), but I&#8217;d prefer it if you read the following as me attempting to follow a form, much as I might try to write a sonnet.  Nee-Nee is my name for my first clown.)

&#8212;&#8211;

The student Kǒu went to the master Nee-Nee.  &#8220;How should I initiate a scene about economic inequality, where my partner must understand that they should play low status to me, and in conflict, and it must be in a village setting so I can use the rest of my ideas for the scene?&#8221; she asked.

Nee-Nee picked up a heavy basket and groaned at its weight.  She said, with satisfaction, &#8220;Thirty pounds of flax.&#8221;
