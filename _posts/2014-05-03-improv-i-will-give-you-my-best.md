This week  I attended Duck Duck Goose in Stockwell on Monday, had a practise on Wednesday, and a Monkey Toast class on Thursday.  I&#8217;ve been trying to apply the character work Jet Eveleth taught me in Copenhagen: Neutral stance, throw body part out of alignment (and let that propagate through the rest of your body), _find a vocalisation_ that gives you a point of view.  Then, during the scene, I&#8217;ve been trying to find a Want for my character.

This was working nicely on Monday, Wednesday and the start of Thursday &#8211; I found establishing a PoV did not immediately lead to a Want and so my scenes on Monday were nice, and felt wholesome, but were a little passive.  Reaching for a Want on Wednesday meant Iost the PoV a little, and at the start of Thursday&#8217;s lesson I feel like I had a scene with both.

Then we moved on to pieces &#8211; a cut down version of the Armando &#8211; and I lost it completely, reverting back to my original self.  I think that I was expecting to be tagged out or swept at any moment and so was in a state of unconscious panic.  This surprised me &#8211; haven&#8217;t I been doing this long enough to learn to trust?  But with the Impronauts after a short while I was one of the most experienced troupe-members, and so there always _was_ a part of me worrying.  That&#8217;s an awful rut I need to get out of immediately, because the one scene I really was happy with on Thursday was where KBF initiated as a homeless person and asked me a really long question: I took the time to absorb it, honestly and slowly replied &#8220;Yes.&#8221; and got a big laugh.  I was immediately tagged out &#8211; but that laugh was the best I got from that piece, and it was when I took a moment to give my best.

So that&#8217;s my newest motto: &#8220;I will give you my _best_&#8220;.  My best is when I&#8217;m slower and richer, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to give you.  And when I&#8217;m on stage, I&#8217;m going to forget that tags and sweeps are even a thing and trust my teammates.
