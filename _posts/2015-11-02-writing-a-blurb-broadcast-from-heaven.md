I&#8217;d like to understand how to attract more people to reading my fiction.  [SilverWood Books](http://www.silverwoodbooks.co.uk/learning-zone/how-to-write-an-inviting-cover-blurb-for-your-book) recommend taking a few books from your shelf in the appropriate genre and rewriting them to be about your story.   They stress you can&#8217;t _use_ these blurbs &#8212; that would be plagiarism &#8212; but they are amazingly fun to read, and the exercise has shown me just how exciting and important a well-written blurb is.  So here is one of the results of that exercise:

**Based on the blurb from _The Rings Of Time_ &#8212; Greg Cox (Star Trek)**

**1992** Gerhard Fuchs, a student at Kaiserslautern University of Technology, was working on distributed consensus algorithms &#8212; the art of finding the truth and exposing hidden liars.  But the building begins whispering to him &#8212; as do the prayers of his classmates.  And when Gerhard attempts to understand just what it is he is hearing, he finds himself suddenly flung across the world in a terrifying journey of intrigue and deceit.

**2000** The psychic hackers gain control of Rio de Janeiro, and everything gets much worse.  Hiding in the shadows, they are grasping at control of a force more powerful than humanity has ever dared tap, threatening the fundamental building blocks of humanity itself.  Struggling to survive in a world teetering on a political knife-edge, Maria Pilar Etxarte gathers up the scattered remnants of the Free Thinkers for one last stand in the stronghold of Finland.  But when a traitor is discovered in their midst, Maria abruptly finds herself in disguise and on the run, with only her medical expertise and telepathic powers to hide her&#8230; or reveal her to her foes.

Two armies.  Two master spies.  And a psychic crisis that spans the entire globe&#8230;
