Two years ago I booked concert tickets to see Ocean Colour Scene at the Roundhouse in London.
The gig was rescheduled due to COVID-19.
Since then, Godaddy broke my email catch-all with no warning.
They did this by migrating me to an Outlook backend with no opt-out.
Outlook don't support catch-alls "for security".
(Translation: we don't want to support this and need an excuse to hide behind).

I'm emailing the Roundhouse to ask if I can have the ticket email address updated.
This post is to say I still control the @toadworld.co.uk domain.
I had a local backup of the emails but my hard drive died.
This was unlucky, but the gig is happening two _years_ after I booked the tickets.

As I write this I'm listening to Saturday, by Ocean Colour Scene, their 2010 album.
I think I bought this after seeing them in 2010!
I still have the mug I bought from that gig!
It broke when I opened a cupboard but I stuck it back together.
I used food-safe resin and food-grade gold-leaf to make a little Kintsugi Ocean Colour Scene cup.

Even the name of my domain, toadworld.co.uk, is from an Ocean Colour Scene song.
It's an acronym of **T**hinking **o**f **a** **D**ifferent world.
This is the refrain from Ocean Colour Scene's *Traveller's Tune*.

I love Ocean Colour Scene and hope I can see them again this December!
