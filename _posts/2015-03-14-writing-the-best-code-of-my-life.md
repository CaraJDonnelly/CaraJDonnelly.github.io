I started a new job at $_COMPANY few months ago. It&#8217;s amazing. I&#8217;m working closely with people who are much better than me at developing software; this week three people on my team were paring my API down to the bone and reminding me of that scene from 1984 (Chapter V).

> <span style="font-size: small;">&#8216;The Eleventh Edition is the definitive edition,&#8217; [Syme] said. &#8216;We&#8217;re getting the language into its final shape &#8212; the shape it&#8217;s going to have when nobody speaks anything else. When we&#8217;ve finished with it, people like you will have to learn it all over again. You think, I dare say, that our chief job is inventing new words. But not a bit of it! We&#8217;re destroying words &#8212; scores of them, hundreds of them, every day. We&#8217;re cutting the language down to the bone. The Eleventh Edition won&#8217;t contain a single word that will become obsolete before the year 2050.&#8217; </span>

Every time a I finished a new draft of my code it seemed like the functions I had written &#8211; which I had just written without thinking hard, in the manner of &#8216;Oh, I&#8217;ll be doing _this_ sort of task so  _these_ sorts of functions will be helpful&#8217; &#8211; were only half necessary.  I had a serious problem where I was learning to code faster than I could code; often I would finish a draft and I would realise everything I had done was wrong, wrong, wrong&#8230; only it would have worked, and previously in my life it would have been the best code I&#8217;d ever written and it was, only it came with the understanding of being able to do better.

I did it TDD-style, too, writing my living specification before implementing my functions, and _oh Mercy I&#8217;ve never been in an environment where there are tests_ in the process I&#8217;ve discovered what a wonderful thing it is to have a complete suite of tests.  To find mistakes in one&#8217;s work, code can be read; code can be compiled; code can be run; but never before have I had just the ability to say &#8220;I have made some changes to this complex interlocking system; now, I would like to know if the system still carries out the _intent_ of every other developer that&#8217;s worked on it since the beginning&#8221;.  Boom!  Possible with just a few keystrokes.  No more am I &#8220;Urgh, this looks finished-ish, let&#8217;s see if it compiles or segfaults&#8221;, and instead I am &#8220;Urgh, this looks finished-ish, let&#8217;s see if the tests pass.&#8221;.  I knew this in theory; now I know it in my heart.  I think that deserves a song!

My PhD would have been at least six months shorter if someone had taught me to code properly.
