I&#8217;ve written up a [new short vignette](http://www.toadworld.co.uk/stories/standalone/orwells-eyes/) (circa 500 words) in the style of Orwell&#8217;s observational fiction, based on my local pub.  There&#8217;s a bizarre effect whereby an author who has authored one of the classic novels of a century has the rest of their novels promoted by association &#8212; not to the same status of a classic, but to the sort of status where the BBC will make an adaptation of one of them at least once every three years.  I&#8217;m also having mild writers block for my serial, Broadcast In Heaven, so anything I can write at the moment is a big plus.

In fact, because this was purely descriptive and entirely based on fact, I think this could be another potential route around writer&#8217;s block.  So now I have two possible routes around writer&#8217;s block:

  * research-and-a-change-of-location, and
  * emotive description of a real place.

These are similar ideas: abdicating responsibility for the story moving forwards in favour of adding depth.  This feels a lot like the mental hook I have that makes me stop in improv scenes to try to re-establish connection.

The vignette is here: [Orwell&#8217;s Eyes](http://www.toadworld.co.uk/stories/standalone/orwells-eyes/).
