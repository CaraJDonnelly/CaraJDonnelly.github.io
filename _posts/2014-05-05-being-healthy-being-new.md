I&#8217;m a lot healthier in a very simple set of ways than I was at the start of 2013.

At the start of 2013 I was well into my fourth year of PhD with only funding for three years, and I was doing what I always did, which was drink and struggle with a coffee addiction.  My coffee intake would go from zero to a cup a day in the mornings to one in the morning, one in the afternoon (plus one if I&#8217;m meeting my supervisor)&#8230; all the way back up to _seven_ cups a day, at which point I would realise I had a problem again and cut back down to zero.  This wasn&#8217;t gourmet coffee, either &#8211; this was the foul brown liquid that tasted more like bleach than coffee that the Cambridge maths department sells.  In August I finally cut it out permanently: I can have it on holiday or for a big deadline, but never again regularly.

Walking to the pub we would always split into two groups, as well &#8211; the orienteers and athletes marching in front, and the rest of us behind.  This began to bother me when I realised that everyone else in the behind group was at least playing squash with one another occasionally, and that I was quite unfit.  This bothered me, so I started doing the NHS C25k, the running podcast.  I had always had asthma and a weak heart valve and been convinced that I couldn&#8217;t exercise; last January it was a struggle for me to run for 3 minutes straight.  Today I ran for 47 minutes at an easy pace, and could have run further.  I also ran a comparable distance on Saturday.

Drinking&#8230; after all of the stress of last year, I needed to unwind, and drinking was my method of choice.  After trying that for a while I was a complete jerk to a dear friend whilst drunk, and realised I needed to spend some time sober.  I&#8217;ve been dry for just under three months, and I&#8217;ve sworn to stay dry until this August &#8211; by far and away the longest stretch of time since I turned 18.

I noticed when I started running that I started drinking less without trying to.  Now I&#8217;ve stopped drinking I&#8217;ve noticed I&#8217;ve started exercising more without trying to: I&#8217;ve really internalised a much healthier way to ease stress.  I&#8217;m proud of that.

So currently I&#8217;m a vegetarian, non-drinking, non-smoking, non-caffeine drinking woman who feels _effective_ in a way she&#8217;s not felt in a very long time.  I tried a yoga class last Tuesday to see if I could be any more stereotypically clean: it was nice, and I&#8217;ll go again this week.
