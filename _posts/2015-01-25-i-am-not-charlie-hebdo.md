On 7 January, 2015, two gunmen attacked the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris and killed twelve people. The gunmen identified themselves as members of Al-Qaeda. In response to the attack upon free speech many, many media outlets and individuals took up the slogan &#8220;je suis Charlie&#8221;. I have a big problem with this.

Charlie Hebdo&#8217;s output was hate speech. Previous hateful Charlie Hebdo covers include (non-exhaustive):

*Mohammed on all fours facing away from the viewer, his scrotum and penis visible, and his anus covered by a small star.

*An unflattering image of pregnant Muslim women shouting &#8220;Don&#8217;t touch our benefits!&#8221; with the caption &#8220;The sex slaves of Boko Haram are angry&#8221; (in reference to the Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping).

*Mohammed appearing in a pornographic film, holding a camera pointing at himself and saying &#8220;And my ass? You like my ass?&#8221;.

Are these cherry-picked examples? Sure &#8211; I&#8217;m not going to waste your time and mine by listing the non-racist covers.

Have we forgotten that there were race riots in Paris just ten years ago, in 2005? Do we really need to point out that being Islam is a pretty good proxy for being an immigrant in France? Maybe, for people from the US who do lack a social safety net, we do need to explain that when people in Europe shout about immigrants and benefits, it&#8217;s not really because they care about balancing the country&#8217;s book; social safety nets are generally a tiny part of national expenditure, an order of magnitude smaller than defence. It&#8217;s because they want someone to blame.

There are respectful and firm ways to reject the religion of other people. Years ago I drew Mohammed, in reaction to those Danish cartoonists being killed: I searched Wikipedia for a painting of him, found one of him holding a pipe and a scroll after signing a peace treaty after a battle, and copied it out as best I could. It wasn&#8217;t the most respectful thing I&#8217;ve ever done &#8211; at the time I was angry at all religions &#8211; but it wasn&#8217;t hateful in the way that a drawing of him, cock out on all fours, is.

So if you&#8217;ve said &#8220;je suis Charlie&#8221; without stopping to think about what narrative you&#8217;re supporting, the narrative in which Muslims are grasping immigrants terrorists sucking money out of Europe then all I&#8217;ve heard you say is &#8220;je suis stupide&#8221;.
