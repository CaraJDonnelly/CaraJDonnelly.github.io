New story: <a href="http://www.toadworld.co.uk/stories/standalone/precinct-11-1028pm/" target="_blank">Precinct 11, 10:28pm</a>

So, I&#8217;ve discovered at work that there are others who want to learn to write good and maybe do other stuff good too. This means I suddenly have a writing group that meets physically and discuss our work!  Consequently I&#8217;m hopeful that my writing shall become clearer.  We&#8217;ve arranged a tutor to come and teach us as well.

This one is a writing exercise of &#8216;dialogue only&#8217; after we had a discussion about the balance between dialogue and description last week.  I had specific questions I asked for feedback on:

&nbsp;

  * __Where is the story set and what are the characters doing?__
  * _How do the two physically-present characters feel about one another?_
  * _The most obvious character who is not present &#8212; why are the characters who are present interested in them?_

I was worried these questions were quite restrictive and specific, with obvious answers, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that I got a spread of answers that were distributed evenly around my intentions, and knowing this let me clarify some points.  It&#8217;s as Professor McIntyre wrote: <a href="http://www.atm.damtp.cam.ac.uk/mcintyre/papers/LHCE/lucidity-science-I.pdf" target="_blank">be twice as explicit as you need to be</a>.

That link again is <a href="http://www.toadworld.co.uk/stories/standalone/precinct-11-1028pm/" target="_blank">Precinct 11, 10:28pm</a>.  Enjoy!
