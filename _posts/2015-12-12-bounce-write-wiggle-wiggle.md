&#8220;I want to be a writer&#8221;

That&#8217;s what Asimov&#8217;s robot Cal said after committing murder &#8212; in self defence, to be sure.  His owner had decided a robot that could write better fiction than him was no robot he wanted to own, and so had ordered Cal destroyed.

I enjoy writing, and I enjoy people reading my writing.  I&#8217;d work out how to grow an audience &#8212; how to write appealing fiction people wish to read, and how to reach those people.  So I started an email list with MailChimp (top right hand corner, if you&#8217;d like to sign up!) about six months ago, I started paying for an Adwords advert for [Broadcast From Heaven](http://www.toadworld.co.uk/stories/broadcast-from-heaven/) about three months ago, and I enabled Google Analytics about two months ago.  Google Analytics has been a bit of a shock.

There&#8217;s a concept I hadn&#8217;t heard of called &#8216;Bounce Rate&#8217;, which is the percentage of people who come to your website, look at one page, then leave.  It&#8217;s always pretty high &#8212; I go to [Things Of Interest](http://qntm.org), a website I really like, pretty regularly to see if there are any updates, since my RSS reader is a bit borked, and so if Sam512 looks at their stats they will presumably see that someone arrived and left about 1 second later when I saw there was no update.  My AdWords ad leads to the contents and blurb for Broadcast From Heaven, so a high bounce rate means people are clicking my ad and either reading the blurb then clicking away, or just looking at the general UX of the website and clicking away.

I set up all of this, and saw a bounce rate (on the Broadcast From Heaven contents page only &#8212; not looking to see if friends are coming to the front page to check for new posts etc.), saw a bounce rate of 100%, and did the sensible thing: nothing for a month.  Between November 6th and December 5th my advert and landing page got a bounce rate of approximately 100% (see graph below).  On December 5th I tried to optimise everything a little bit:

  * I cut the blurb in half, removing the details which I thought didn&#8217;t stand well on their own.
  * I made the advert working much more direct, changing the heading from &#8220;Broadcast From Heaven&#8221; to &#8220;The Hackers Were Psychic&#8221;.
  * I tidied up the landing page a bit, making the links to the chapters a bit more obvious and adding &#8216;Contents&#8217; to the title so that people would understand they could click through.
  * I removed a bunch of automatic keywords from my AdWords ad to make it more targeted at people looking for something new &#8212; people searching for &#8216;classic science fiction&#8217; are not at that point looking for a free new serial.

My bounce rate, the rate of disinterest in this story, dropped from about 100% to about 80% (at the very end of the graph, the final few days), and my average pages per session climbs up significantly:

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-569 aligncenter" src="http://www.toadworld.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/bounce_rate-300x156.png" alt="Bounce rate percentage and average pages for session for Broadcast From Heaven." width="300" height="156" srcset="http://www.toadworld.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/bounce_rate-300x156.png 300w, http://www.toadworld.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/bounce_rate.png 496w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](http://www.toadworld.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/bounce_rate.png)and you can see why it&#8217;s important to wait for a month between changes like this &#8212; because my advert gets around 10 clicks a day, I don&#8217;t have _many_ visitors in the grand scheme of things and the data are very spiky, and arguably it doesn&#8217;t even many any sense for me to write _this_ post for at least another three weeks so I can really measure the change.  But that drop in bounce rate suggests to me that I made a change that was good.  The Internet suggests that 60% would be a good target.

More thought needed.  But given that I have 29 separate stories up on this site, ranging from [drabbles](http://www.toadworld.co.uk/stories/drabbles/can-you-tell-what-it-is-yet/) to my last 13-chapter [abortive attempt at a novel](http://www.toadworld.co.uk/stories/the-maze/), it seems wise to spend some time _exposing_ these stories, and thinking about engagement and building an audience &#8212; core parts of being an author.
