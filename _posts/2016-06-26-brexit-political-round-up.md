Summary: the UK is in deep trouble.  Let&#8217;s take it section by section.

# Geographically

  * **Scotland** voted Remain.  A second Scottish Independence referendum is [&#8216;highly likely&#8217;](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36621030).  Sturgeon, head of the SNP, has said Holyrood could [block Brexit](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36633244).
  * **London** voted Remain.  Sadiq Khan [reassured EU citizens living in London](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/london-referendum-results-sadiq-khan-bids-to-reassure-london-as-it-votes-by-60-per-cent-for-remain-a3279991.html) and has stated [London must have a seat at the Brexit negotiations](http://www.cityam.com/244141/sadiq-khan-london-must-have-seat-around-brexit-negotiating).
  * **Northern Ireland** voted Remain. Sinn Fein have [called for a re-unification poll](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-northern-ireland-eu-referendum-result-latest-live-border-poll-united-martin-mcguinness-a7099276.html).  The Irish Times report fears of an [Irish recession](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/what-does-brexit-nightmare-mean-for-ireland-1.2697702) and a re-ignition of the Troubles, describing Brexit as &#8220;[a bewildering act of self-harm](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/brexit/irish-times-view-brexit-a-bewildering-act-of-self-harm-1.2698212)&#8220;.
  * **England** voted Leave, notably the [Labour heartlands](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/labour-heartlands-give-huge-backing-8271074) in the North of England.  These areas loathe Westminster after [decades of mistreatment](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/06/i-want-my-country-back).
  * **Cornwall** and **Wales** voted Leave.  They are both now clamouring to continue receiving EU subsidy.  Since 2000 [Wales has received £4bn](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-36619404) and [Cornwall has received £1bn](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-36616955) from the EU.

# Economically

  * The Pound has [dropped 6.5%](http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=GBP&to=USD&view=1M) against the dollar after the announcement of Brexit.  This is a 9% drop since January when campaigning began.
  * UK research relies on the EU for [16% of its funding](http://www.vox.com/2016/6/24/12023772/brexit-vote-uk-science-terrified); the EU contributed approximately [£3.4bn between 2007-13](http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-brexit-hurt-science/22650) to UK science.  The expected ~£20m drop in [EU Arts funding](http://www.wsj.com/articles/arts-world-assesses-how-brexit-will-play-on-funding-1466859029) makes the UK film industry less attractive to US studios that might film here.
  * [The Financial Times reports banks are already preparing to leave London](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a3a92744-3a52-11e6-9a05-82a9b15a8ee7.html#axzz4CiP0aQFs).  HSBC indicated it will [move 1000 jobs to Paris](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36629745) if the UK loses access to the Single Market.
  * Whitbread indicated they would reduce investment as Brexit [would hit UK tourism](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/06/21/costa-coffee-gives-whitbread-sales-a-jolt-amid-weak-hotel-market/).

# Politically

  * CON: Cameron will [step down as Prime Minister](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/david-cameron-resigns-prime-minister-samantha-cameron-emotional-brexit-eu-referendum-a7100126.html).  There is [no clear successor](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36618738).
  * LAB: Corbyn&#8217;s shadow cabinet have chosen this period of relative quiet to [attack their own leader](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/live-labour-resignations-tories-turmoil-8284555).  They are proposing a vote of no confidence.
  * LIB: Farron has pledged to [disregard the referendum result](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-referendum-result-lib-dems-remain-liberal-democrats-live-policy-stay-leave-a7103186.html) and keep the UK in the EU should the Lib Dems be elected.
  * UKIP: Farage [backtracked Vote Leave NHS promises](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-referendum-nigel-farage-nhs-350-million-pounds-live-health-service-u-turn-a7102831.html) immediately after the polls closed and has denied that [Brexit has caused a British recession](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nigel-farage-says-recession-not-8287362).
  * SNP: As mentioned under &#8216;Geographically&#8217;, the SNP is promising a second Scottish Independence referendum.
  * EU leaders are split over the [pace of Brexit negotiations](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/eu-founding-members-britain-agree-quick-divorce-europe-exit).  The French foreign minister has asked the UK to have a new PM &#8216;[within days&#8217;](http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/683313/Brexit-vote-France-Britain-trigger-Article-50-EU-choose-new-Prime-Minister-within-days).  Merkel has [advised caution](http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/brexit-has-triggered-diplomacy-and-crisis-response-in-berlin-a-1099787.html).

# Culturally

  * Lord Ashcroft&#8217;s has [published polls](http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/) showing the breakdown of votes.  Voters were more likely to vote Leave if they were [older, poorer and less educated](http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/06/britains-great-divide/) &#8212; cross reference above with the neglected Labour heartlands.  Younger voters have been [left disheartened](http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/06/brexit-political-awakening-young-people/).
  * [A wave of racist abuse](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-eu-referendum-racial-racism-abuse-hate-crime-reported-latest-leave-immigration-a7104191.html) has swept the UK.  Cards reading &#8216;[No more Polish vermin](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/racist-incidents-feared-to-be-linked-to-brexit-result-reported-in-england-and-wales)&#8216; were posted outside a school in Huntingdon.  Two weeks prior a pro-refugee MP Jo Cox was [shot and killed](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/jo-cox-dead-live-updates-8207676) by a member of the fascist group Britain First.
  * The Independent notes that sober descriptions of Brexit have now been published in [the Sun](http://indy100.independent.co.uk/article/the-sun-has-also-got-around-to-telling-its-readers-what-brexit-will-mean-and-they-are-not-happy--WySvafrAVZ) and [the Mail](http://indy100.independent.co.uk/article/the-mail-has-explained-what-brexit-means-and-its-readers-seem-shocked--Z1772TI4aNW).

# Summary

Chaos.  The two major parties are headless.  Scotland is striding towards the door.  NI is furious at England.  England is furious at itself.  Our allies are dumbfounded.  We are entering a long period of uncertainty.

We must guard against the rise of fascism in Britain.
