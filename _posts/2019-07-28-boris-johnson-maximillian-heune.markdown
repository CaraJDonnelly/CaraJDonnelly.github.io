Every introduction to the UK's new Prime Minister Johnson mentions his biography of the failed naval commander and advocate of concentration camps Winston Churchill.
It is widely accepted that Johnson styles himself after Churchill, most famous for being Prime Minister during WWII.
However, Johnson is not Winston Churchill.
In all of history, Johnson is in my view most similar to Caspar, a 1930s gay prostitute who briefly dated the American novelist Isherwood, before later joining the Nazi party.

Isherwood is most famous for his semi-autobiographical **Berlin Stories** (1945); here Caspar is folded into "Clive Mortimer", a wealthy American socialite who abandons his friends abruptly.
**Berlin Stories** was adapted as a film musical **Cabaret** (1972) and Clive Mortimer became Baron Maximillian von Heune.
Von Heune is an aristocrat fueling the racial tensions in Germany, with the intention of controlling Germany cia the Nazi party.

Of course, they failed; the populist movement of the Nazis was beholden only to Hitler.
In **Cabaret** we see this at the close of the song "Tomorrow Belongs To Me".
Brian Roberts (representing Isherwood) asks von Heune (representing Caspar)

> You still think you can control them?

and von Heune sneers, embarassed.

Johnson campaigned to take the UK out of its main trading and security block with the expectation of losing.
Recall his speech on the resignation of David Cameron

and look at the fear in his eyes as he realizes

> I think we can be very proud of the result.

that his gamble has left him holding a turd.
Now, Johnson has doubled down on his lies.
Johnson demands that the EU should abandon its commitment to the Good Friday Agreement.
This is the agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland to which the UK is also a signatory.

Johnson stands on a national stage and makes this demand of the EU, stating without evidence that

> the evidence is that other arrangements are perfectly possible

while offering no other arrangements and threatening to crash the UK out of the EU.
Crashing out of the EU will disrupt food and medical supplies, and leave Northern Ireland in an undefined state.
The Good Friday Agreement requires that there be no hard border on the island of Ireland.
Without trade agreements between the UK and the EU, the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, and the rUK will be in legal free-fall.

Johnson must be opposed on moral grounds, as his actions are selfish and will hurt people.
Beyond that, his casual treatment of human life is an attack upon European values and human rights.
He must be rejected by the UK at all costs.
