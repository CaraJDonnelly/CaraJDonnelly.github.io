TJ and Dave, improvisers so skilled they have a documentary about them, are going around Europe with Stefan Pagels Andersen, doing shows and teaching workshops.  Tickets for their show were sold out when I tried to buy, but I got a workshop place.  My notes are [here](http://www.toadworld.co.uk/?page_id=310).

Taking notes on workshops about emotional truth is difficult &#8211; you need to give detail or things don&#8217;t make sense, but I don&#8217;t want ever to give identifying details because those workshops are safe spaces.  Also you learn a lot by experience and in such a short period of time there&#8217;s not time to dedicate an exercise to each aspect that the teachers understand or conceptualise, so all the information comes in a fast stream that is very responsive to what has happened so far in the workshop.  This makes taking notes very difficult, and I&#8217;ve ended up with something approximating the style of [Sanford Meisner On Acting](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/140507.Sanford_Meisner_on_Acting) &#8211; sort of half a transcript and half not.  I offer no guarantees, and I strongly recommend you seek them out, go to their shows, and study with them if you can.
