I&#8217;ve been doing improv a long while, but only relatively recently started paying for tuition.  That means I&#8217;m suddenly getting a lot more abstract understanding of tags and sweeps.

In a longform piece one changes location by either &#8216;sweeping&#8217; &#8211; clearing the stage and beginning a story not directly related to the previous story &#8211; or by &#8216;tagging&#8217; &#8211; clearing the stage of all but one character and taking that character to a new context.  Sweeps change what thread you&#8217;re currently following, and tags advance what thread you&#8217;re currently following, with most longforms having three threads.  Tags are faster and allow a simple route in to &#8216;game&#8217;: if a character crashes their car and says &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how my day could get any worse!&#8221; then someone on the sidelines will likely tag in and take them to a situation in which their day has indeed got worse (tag: &#8220;Welcome to _jail_, sir.&#8221;).  In that gamey context someone else will immediately tag in and heighten further (tag: &#8220;Dead man walking!  Dead man walking!  I hope this teaches you to drive safely in the future.&#8221;) and further (tag: &#8220;Welcome to heaven!  If you&#8217;ll just present your clean driver&#8217;s license&#8230;&#8221;) and _sweep_ to a new scene.

Sometimes this goes poorly, especially in a jam context where you don&#8217;t know each other&#8217;s style.  I&#8217;ve been in this situation twice in the last month: everyone picks up on the game and one person is left in the hotseat (&#8216;person that stabs everyone&#8217; or &#8216;psychiatrist that gives bad advice&#8217;) but the heightening doesn&#8217;t take.  I was the &#8216;person that stabs everyone&#8217; and there&#8217;s a particular sudden feeling of desperation when you realise that you&#8217;re being carried along from scene to scene _and things aren&#8217;t going well_ &#8211; the game didn&#8217;t land and when the joy of playing that game evaporated it took with it your ability to put energy into each line.  Nick Moseley summed this up in _Meisner in Practise_ (Chapter 7, p127) as &#8220;There is nothing more painful for an actor than to find himself trapped in a fake dialogue.&#8221;.

If you&#8217;re on the sidelines it&#8217;s your responsibility to help your teammate in trouble.  It&#8217;s simple to tag out the person who is carrying the burden of the dead game, and show a large consequence which &#8211; because it breaks the pattern which has become painful for everyone on stage &#8211; will immediately get swept and allow the birth of a new scene, but I think next time I see this happen I shall tag in and try to drop us in to a deep connection scene with the person that was carrying the joyless game.  This would still be short &#8211; we&#8217;re still trying to get our footing back after we stumbled out of sync with each other &#8211; but I think could be more satisfying emotionally than following one consequence of the game.
