I used to be a lazy little sod, who would drink all night and sleep through all of her lectures.  My first year of university was basically one big hangover.  It was great.  Second year I learned to sit in the front row rather than the back row (but still slept), and in third year I learned I took things in a lot more if I colour-coded my notes on the fly &#8211; one black pen, one red pen, one blue pen, one green pen.  Blue for theorem headings, green for definitions, red for warnings or important points &#8211; the _clack-clack-clack_ of me changing pens every sentence made a nice rhythm.

My habit of writing things down has stayed, and because I now have a handbag of sensible size I can take my journal everywhere I go.  So here is a [list of troupes I have seen](http://www.toadworld.co.uk/?page_id=133), and later today I will upload my [Monkey Toast course notes so far](http://www.toadworld.co.uk/?page_id=141).
