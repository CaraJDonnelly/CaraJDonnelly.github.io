I love Harvey, and I enjoyed this adaptation of it. Harvey (the 1950s film), if you&#8217;ve never seen it, is the kind of film that&#8217;s on every Christmas. James Stewart plays Elwood P. Dowd, a man who has an invisible 6&#8242; 3 1/2&#8221; rabbit for his best friend, and his family can&#8217;t cope. It&#8217;s a nice film about how, actually, what&#8217;s in people&#8217;s hearts is more important than what&#8217;s in their heads, and how people work out how to be good to each other.

There are a bunch of poor reviews floating around for this show. I&#8217;d be lying if I didn&#8217;t acknowledge that the production felt a little stilted in the first half &#8211; in the very first scene in particular I felt that Ingrid Oliver and Lipman were a bit overwhelmed by the amount of exposition that they had to do (&#8220;My uncle-your brother-invisible friend&#8230;&#8221; breath _in_ &#8220;&#8230;high society-alcoholism-family history&#8230;&#8221;) but if you forgive that &#8211; and if you&#8217;re sitting watching Harvey probably you are in the mood to forgive something &#8211; then the second act trips along very nicely, with Dreyfus really finding his groove as the slightly damaged Dowd, to the point where I did want to just hug him for a bit. Lipman, too, has a particularly nice moment at the end where she casts off the her assigned role in life to tell Judge Gaffney to stop calling her &#8220;old girl&#8221;.  Strong supporting cast, and they&#8217;ll improve as the run continues.

Harvey himself was excellent, of course.

I saw this show with family, and we got half-price tickets from the booth in Leicester Square &#8211; they were only around £13 each. For a really lovely evening, definitely worth it. Good set, too &#8211; loved the rotating chequered floors.  Made me realise when watching it that I always imagined the taxi-driver from Arsenic and Old Lace is the same taxi driver as from Harvey.
