What do I _want_ to do with my life?  There&#8217;s been a post making the rounds that &#8220;you already know your passion, it&#8217;s the thing you can&#8217;t do without&#8221;, which is horseshit.  My muse wanders.  Sometimes I&#8217;m staying up till 2AM sewing waistcoats, sometimes I&#8217;m writing until I can sleep because the stories cling to me until I scrape them onto the page, sometimes I&#8217;m doing five nights of improv a week.

Anyway, here are two very short stories: [Snowdrops](http://www.toadworld.co.uk/?page_id=536) and [Cafe Undelighet](http://www.toadworld.co.uk/?page_id=538)

PS. Broadcast From Heaven is still going on, just this next chapter has a lot happening in it.
