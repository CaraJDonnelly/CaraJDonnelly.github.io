So, most languages have gendered nouns.  _La table_ in French, _der Wagen_ in German, _dziecko_ in Polish.  English is missing out!  But we can&#8217;t just add in gendered nouns &#8211; that would introduce all kinds of back-compatibility issues.  Therefore, I invoke the [_use-mention distinction_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use%E2%80%93mention_distinction) &#8211; the difference between the sofa I&#8217;m sitting on, and the &#8220;sofa&#8221;, one of the two words meaning a soft seat in English that have Arabic origin (the other being &#8220;divan&#8221;).

We rarely mention words in English, unless we are linguists, and if we _are_ linguists (and we aren&#8217;t), we **love** the use-mention distinction, and adding gender to languages that previously had no gendered nouns!  Thus, I declare the following:

> All **mentions** of English words now have the following gender: female (the**f**) if from a Romance language, male (the**m**) if from a Germanic language, and neuter (the**n**) if from any other root.

This tags each word with its rough etymology, and would be invaluable for writers of fiction: consider a bluff Norwichman whose surrounding prose is written using largely Germanic-origin English words &#8211; a fine example being the**m** word &#8216;then&#8217;.  We can easily signal in the prose itself the discomfort this bluff Norwichman might feel at an unpleasant turn of events by having him _say_ the**m** word &#8216;then&#8217;, but have the indirect speech use the**f** word &#8216;subsequently&#8217; at the start of the descriptive passage where things start to go wrong.

We see similar clarity arising in the**f** word &#8216;theme&#8217;, the**n** letter &#8216;theta&#8217;,  the**m** words &#8216;the&#8217; and &#8216;them&#8217;, and indeed the**m** words &#8216;the**f**&#8216;, &#8216;the**n**&#8216; and &#8216;the**m**&#8216;.  Yeah, them &#8216;the**m**&#8216; words.

I expect my Nobel Fields Trophy for Linguistics to be in the post.
