Hullo, new short story up: [Wigner&#8217;s Friend](http://www.toadworld.co.uk/?page_id=530).  This one is short, and very silly, and based entirely on solid hard Science and is not stupid at all.

I&#8217;ve worked out what I do wrong with writing, which is to get bogged down in worrying about things.  I write stories of 1000 words because that&#8217;s how long my attention span for one idea (unless it&#8217;s a very good idea, like a game of Go or a delicious hash brown/veggie burger combo, with delicious chutney and fresh tomato) is.  Vignettes ahoy.
