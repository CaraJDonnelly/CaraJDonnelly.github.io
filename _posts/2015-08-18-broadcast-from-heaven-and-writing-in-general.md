Writing bores me.  A few thousand words in and I feel like I&#8217;ve explored pretty much everything to do with a situation, a feeling I&#8217;ve probably learned from years of 3-minute improv scenes.  I want to get around this, because I love writing and I want to work on larger pieces, but I firmly believe that short stories should be fun and playful and _emotionally cheap_.  I very much like Ursula Le Guin, but I cannot read her short stories because I find them exhausting &#8212; every one I finish and I feel I have burned away a little part of my life energy because they are _so_ rich, _so_ alive that I cannot read more than one a week even if I am making a concerted effort.  I can read and adore Borges because his short stories, even the ones about murder and war, are all quite silly.  So I cannot spend time trying to &#8216;perfect&#8217; my short stories because perfection in short stories means that the stories are no longer cheap, are no longer playful.

I tried writing a longer piece in the form of [The Maze!](http://www.toadworld.co.uk/?page_id=222) by speed-writing, but the output is profoundly depressing dreck.  Again from improv, &#8216;narrative&#8217; is something I hate &#8212; who would ever read a story where the people in it act as they do because the story demands it rather than because they are alive?  And if I try to let my characters do what they want they all sit down and refuse to do anything in a manner which is certainly not playful.

So I&#8217;ve started a serial, _[Broadcast From Heaven](http://www.toadworld.co.uk/?page_id=497)_, and I’m now two chapters in.  Each chapter will be a new location and main character, unless some characters particularly want to come back, and at least the first half of the story will be driven by the starting sentence:

> **The psychic hackers learnt Portuguese, and things got much worse.**

I&#8217;d like it very much if you read along, and commented to say if there&#8217;s anything in particular you&#8217;d like to learn more about in the world I&#8217;ll paint.  You can sign up to get email updates using the email form on this website &#8212; Facebook hides posts in unpredictable ways, so an email list is more reliable.
