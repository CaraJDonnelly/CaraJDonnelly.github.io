  These past two weeks have been crazy great.  Saw the Manic Street Preachers, got taught improv and clowning by Jet Eveleth in Copenhagen as part of the CPH impro Festival.  Got back, attended a jam, saw James McAspeney&#8217;s new show Sitting Up For Michael, an improv practise, an improv lesson, Friday night in, Saturday&#8230;

  Saturday doing <a href="http://onestoptheatre.wordpress.com/">One Stop Theatre</a> with Rachael Castell!  A new theatre movement &#8211; we hop on the Tube, do a scene or a poem, and hop off at the next stop.  People loved us &#8211; click through to read a more thorough account.  Then off to James Ross&#8217; Edinburgh preview show, which had lots of good material.

  Today was spent just migrating things from my old server in our living room to bluehost &#8211; every time something broke it would take me months to get the energy up to fix the damn thing &#8211; which was productive if not fun.
