You&#8217;d better watch out
  
You&#8217;d better code DRY
  
You&#8217;d better not pout
  
I&#8217;m telling you why
  
The head of Ops is making the rounds

He&#8217;s making a diff
  
He&#8217;s checking it twice
  
He&#8217;s gonna \`git blame\` who&#8217;s naughty or nice
  
The head of Ops is making the rounds

He sees you when you&#8217;re merging
  
He knows when you rebase
  
He knows if you called fetch or pull
  
So don&#8217;t pull for goodness sake[1]

With unit test suites and Agile day scrums
  
Pre-commit hooks and \`git bisect\` runs
  
The head of Ops is making the rounds
  
The head of Ops is making the rounds
  
The head of Ops is making the rounds

[Chorus: He sees you when you&#8217;re merging&#8230;]

[First verse reprise: You&#8217;d better watch out&#8230;]

(Making the rounds)
  
He&#8217;s a busy man; he&#8217;s got no time to play
  
He&#8217;s got millions of branches to merge before release day
  
(The head of Ops is making the rounds)
  
(Making the rounds)
  
(The head of Ops is making the rounds)
  
(Making the rounds)

[1] Pulling rather than fetching can introduce an unnecessary merge commit that clutters up the history.
