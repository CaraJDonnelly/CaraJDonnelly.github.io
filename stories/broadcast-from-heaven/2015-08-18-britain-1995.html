<p>The psychic hackers learnt Portuguese in 1999, and things got much worse.</p>
<p>The problems had started in London, in late March, 1995.  Davey Hamm had got back from the big funeral in Chingford -- you know the one -- to find his manor looked <em>wrong</em>.  Usually you'd see the kids hanging out sulking on the streets by the chip shop, usually you'd see a queue of pensioners waiting to get their giro at the post office, usually you'd see a copper looking miserable outside the bank where you could definitely see him, and so could his guvnor when his guvnor drove past checking he wasn't slacking.  Today you couldn't see none of that.  Today his manor looked wrong.  Bit yellow, maybe.</p>
<p>He pulled his dark blue Rover SD1 over to the side of the high street and parked.  If no coppers meant a raid, there was no harm waiting a few minutes to see what was going on -- specially since the car he was in was clean as anything, what with him having just been to the big funeral and all -- you didn't take the piss when you were visiting with people who could send their boys round to knock your teeth in, and woe betide him who ever considered trying to retaliate against those customers, because they didn't mess about.  So he was clean.</p>
<p>The unmarked green Ford Mondeo right behind him started flashing blue from a stick-on siren and he grinned.  "Called it," he said to himself, got out of the car and started hoofing it down by the old furniture shop down towards the Little John pub next to the St Paul's Church.</p>
<p>His brother Nicky would have a go at him for this, later, for running away and looking suspicious, and Davey would always shrug it off: they've cleared out the area and they're right behind you in a plainclothes car, right?  No chances of not ending up at the station today with Micawber sitting on the other side of the desk doing his tough-guy act -- Micawber was alright, though, for a copper he knew the score -- so why not make the fuckers run for it?  Make them think he was hiding something on him, and when they searched him and couldn't find anything, make them take apart the car.  Piss off the beat bobbies, the ones that have to do a ten hour search every time they nick you and find nothing, all the while you're saying their guvnor hates you and it's just cause you're from the wrong end of the Roman Road, and you can see on their faces and in their bodies how they start to think maybe their guvnor is a fucking idiot.  Maybe he is just out to get this poor sod you've searched three times that never has nothin' on him, maybe it's all a waste of fucking time.  And you remember the beat bobbies' names in a friendly way and don't make a point of it, and it's all gravy when it comes time to turn one of them to get them to give you warning before the next search comes along.</p>
<p>Davey had had a bit of a friendly competition running with Mike from down on Wick Lane about who could get searched the most within six months, but Nicky had put his foot down and told him to stop being a wanker while there was business to take care of.  But a plain-clothes car out of nowhere?  They were begging to have their time wasted.</p>
<p>He saw another green Ford Mondeo car coming down St Stephen's Road towards him and angled right down to the path leading to Wright's Road to go past the houses behind the church.  As he reached the mouth of the road he saw a divot appear in the tarmac of the street in front of him, and a half-second later his ears registered a quiet bang from the second Ford Mondeo.</p>
<p>They were <em>shooting</em> at him.  He put on a burst of proper speed, now, and aimed for the line of trees on the side of the road -- word was the Met had killed about 30 people in custody in the last few years, and there was no way he was stopping to see if that shot had been a proper warning shot at the ground in front of him or just rubbish aim.  Why the fuck didn't he have a fucking gun with him?</p>
<p>Things were going to get a bit tasty.</p>
<p>He could see the crackle in the air of the radio, heading past him up towards Libra Road.  No point running that way.  Davey could see the pulses between people the way Stefan, the German, could smell trouble in his gang and head trouble off before it became trouble.  This wasn't just a few coppers out to get a good nick and make themselves a name down in Broadway, this was a tight team that was proper trained together, probably SO13, the old Bomb Squad.</p>
<p>Fu-uck.  He had laundry to do today, too.</p>
<p>He stopped halfway down the avenue of trees and risked a glance back down Wright's Road.  The two green Ford Mondeos had halted at the corner of the footpath and Allen Road, one on either side of the road, presumably secure in the knowledge that the other end of the road was blocked off by whoever was at the other end of the radio.  He needed to do something surprising.</p>
<p>He turned back up the road and started at a dead run for Beale Place and the Old Ford Primary School.  The second green Ford Mondeo -- the one that had shot at him -- shot forwards from its position and came at him with a roar -- he heard a screech of tires behind him when he was halfway down the Place -- and he took a deep breath and dumped his leather jacket behind him.  No time for weight.  No time to wait.  He started to grin and straight away heard another soft puff a foot to his left -- another divot appeared in the tarmac and grit scattered out in the air.  Another shot.</p>
<p>He reached the iron gate and jumped up to the crossbar halfway up.  He hauled with his hands and jumped with his legs and got his feet up to the top bar, then toppled over and landed hard on the grit of the playground on his left wrist.  He staggered up and noted with satisfaction that he hadn't been shot at again in the last five seconds -- these coppers were out to kill him, but not so much that they'd shoot into a school and risk killing a kid.</p>
<p>It was 2pm, and the children were all inside.  He had maybe thirty seconds head start on the ones behind him in the car as they climbed over the gate, and maybe two minutes before they managed to radio someone to come in the other way.  He shoved open one of the double doors and headed into the main hallway, then hit a hard left, taking him out of sight of the police, then quickly doubled back up a set of stairs to the Science classrooms.  He ducked in to a dark supply cupboard and walked quickly to its end, where two doors with glass upper-halves led into two full classrooms.  One of them led to Lesley Kettle's class, and he was lucky enough to catch her eye immediately.  He made a sharp <em>here, now</em> gesture and stepped backwards out of sight of the kids.  No point scaring everyone.</p>
<p>He heard Lesley tell her class to copy out page eighty-three and then she was there in the supply cupboard with him.</p>
<p>"Davey?" Lesley said. "Is everything alright?  Is Thomas..."</p>
<p>Her voice had trailed off and Davey opened his mouth to reassure her, then shut it again.  He had no idea if Thomas Kettle, Lesley's husband and one of his boys, was alright, and he had no business telling her he was right after being shot at twice by the fuzz.</p>
<p>"I don't know," he said, honestly. "Some plainclothes coppers clapped their sirens on then tried to shoot me in broad daylight, no joke.  Lesley, I need to get out of here without being seen.  You should phone Thomas and tell him to get the fuck out of town for a while."</p>
<p>He saw her face turn white, then the white drifted off her and started to flow smoothly in one direction, towards East.  That would be where Thomas was, then.</p>
<p>"I think he's okay," he said, more confidently, and added "you'd know if something had happened."</p>
<p>Lesley nodded, not really convinced.  "They're going to think you have hostages."</p>
<p>"Bollocks to that, I'm not a fuckin' psycho.  I've never taken hostages in my life, or killed anyone."  Davey Hamm, hard man, paused.  "Anyone that didn't have it coming," he clarified.</p>
<p>But she was right.  He hadn't heard nothing since running in to the school, and if they saw him now he was definitely dead, shot on suspicion of having a gun in a school.  But if they had to close down the school to take him in and the papers got to say 'guns' and 'school' in the same headline then the neighbourhood wouldn't be Davey and Nicky's no more, and they'd have to move to Spain.</p>
<p>"Bollocks," he said.  "I give up.  Call the police then call Mickey Baker at the Standard to come take photos."  He scowled.  "I don't want any funny business when they take me in."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>New Scotland Yard was made of big triangular lumps of concrete that had looked snazzy in the 60s, either because the architect was high on acid or because they thought getting high was the work of the Devil.  Davey was generally dragged down here every time someone at the NCIS, the National Criminal Intelligence Service, got promoted and needed to flex their muscles.  Davey didn't mind that too much; being dragged down to Scotland Yard was all part of the image -- no-one wants a fixer who wore suits and spoke like they were at the fucking opera.</p>
<p>This time was different, though.  Mickey Baker had turned up and taken a few snaps then had to scarper as one of the Bomb Squad ran at him, ran straight at a journo holding a camera.  And there had been guns.  And they'd been waiting for him.</p>
<p>"Who did you piss off this time, Hamm?"</p>
<p>Superintendent Micawber was a large, narrow man.  He accomplished this mix by putting solid, Army-style muscles on a thin frame, and the effect was that of looking at someone in a fairground mirror.  He took the view that if your manor was quiet and the only people getting the shit kicked out of them were other crims, he didn't want to hear about it.</p>
<p>Davey stayed quiet, thrust his hands into the pockets of the jacket the police had returned to him.  Micawber wasn't bent, but that didn't mean he was stupid, and until Davey knew what the score was his mouth was staying shut.</p>
<p>The door to the interrogation room opened, and a smiling man in a pressed grey suit walked in, bringing with him a smell of oranges.  The smiling man nodded to Jackson and seated himself on the other side of the table.  Jackson's face had gone cold and unhappy, but he nodded back and left.</p>
<p>There was no tape recorder on the table.  Davey glanced involuntarily at the one-way glass, and the smiling man's smile broadened.</p>
<p>"David Hamm, I presume?" The smiling man said, practically purring on the word 'presume'.</p>
<p>"I'll have my lawyer, thanks," said Davey.  Sometimes it was worth letting them ask a few questions, seeing if you couldn't tell what they were aiming at, but not this time.  He was going to get safe, first, then worry about what the fuck was going on.</p>
<p>"No," said the smiling man.  "Not today."  He tilted his head to one side and began to write longhand notes in a graceful, looping hand.</p>
<p>Davey stared at the man, then started properly <em>looking</em> the way Stefan had taught him to, looking to see the pale colours drifting off his skin and flowing away.  The different colours meant different things -- white for fear, none of that here, blue for proud loyalty, plenty, flowing all about in the station, so this bloke was police or some such -- and green for greed, a thin pale strand flowing straight towards and through the one-way mirror -- and another flowing straight towards him.</p>
<p>He glanced at the mirror again, and the smiling man put a photograph on the table.  It showed three people on a couch, obviously at a party.  He was in the middle.</p>
<p>"Perhaps, Mr Hamm," the smiling man leaned forwards and cocked his head even further to one side, "you could tell us everything you know about Mehdi Jannati."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Mehdi Jannati was a businessman, an Iranian with interests in aerospace engineering.  He was rich and he was popular, and he was quite a catch.  Francesca Featherstone was a journalist, tipped to be the first female editor of The Times, British with contacts across all industries and at all levels.  Their parties would have been called legendary, if they had been the kind of parties that indiscreet people got invited to, but they weren't -- they were the kind of parties that were full of people who knew how to keep their mouth shut.</p>
<p>Davey was Francesca's cockney fixer, a loveable rogue in a leather jacket who could get your packages in and out of the country without paying any import/export duties, be those packages antique furniture, expensive cars, or a shitload of cocaine.  Most of the stuff the Hamms just shipped through their company perfectly legally, quietly absorbing the cost of the duties themselves -- it was good for business to look like crafty smugglers, and the contacts they made through Francesca's parties bought more than enough coke to offset the cost.  The irregular, weird shipments were good too, because crime is a business where you have to be flexible enough to wait an extra day here and there for a late product to come through, and flexible enough to get the /fuck out of town, now/, when you need to.</p>
<p>Everyone loved Davey.  He could see it when he walked into a room, the little golden glow that would surge towards him.  He knew everyone, and more importantly, he knew who liked who and how.  Everyone took him aside and asked him quietly what he thought of their latest deals, be they social or business.</p>
<p>Tonight, Francesca herself had taken him upstairs, ostensibly to show him some mahogany paintings she wanted shipped to the Dodecanese.  As soon as they had reached her upstairs combination room, she quietly closed the door behind her and turned to him with a look of mild concern on her face.  For Francesca Featherstone, this was more vulnerability than she would normally show in a year.</p>
<p>"David," she began, "I'm worried that Mehdi is going to break things off."</p>
<p>Davey relaxed and grinned a wide grin.  Easy street.  "Francesca, I happen to know for a fact that he loves you almost like one of his planes.  He --"</p>
<p>Francesca interrupted him.  "I know he loves me, David."  She swallowed, painfully.  "I think he thinks marrying him will wreck my career."  She drew in a breath.  "He's right.  The Americans are rattling their sabres again and the Times is expected to be on point."  She looked up at him.  "Could you tell him to get his head out of his arse and let me worry about my problems?"</p>
<p>"I'll talk to him about it," he promised.</p>
<p>She led him back downstairs, and he started to work the crowd.  There were shipments to modestly shrug about, well-dressed and driven women to make eyes at and coke to snort.  The colours in the room shone brighter after a few drinks, and he found himself on a sofa between Francesca and Medhi.  Flowing between them was bright pulses of gold, gold, gold, a little red for lust, gold, gold, gold.  Davey leaned forward and breathed in, his head swimming from champagne, good food, and a good party.  He could feel the wisps of emotions flow through him as he took deep breaths.</p>
<p>The next breath of gold he held in his lungs for a second.  His head thrummed.  He breathed out.</p>
<p>It came out blue.  Dark, dark blue.  It flowed to his right to where Mehdi was sprawled, a relaxed smile on his face.  When the blue hit him he blinked and looked over at Francesca, sitting on Davey's right.  When Mehdi next breathed out the pulse of colour Davey saw was gold threaded with a soft blue glow.  Davey leaned out of the way and watched the blue/gold mix flow to Francesca, who breathed it in like roses on an overcast day.  Her expression intensified, as though she were deep in thought.  Her next pulse was tinged with blue as well, and as the three of them sat there Davey watched the colours deepen and thicken until there were two strong streams, one glowing blue, one shining gold, both flowing in both directions at once.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>"I want my lawyer," said Davey Hamm.  "I aint got nothing more to say to you.  I aint done nothing."</p>
<p>"You promised Francesca Featherstone," -- the smiling man, oozing green towards Davey, pronounced it 'Fanshaw' with an 'a' so short it sounded more like 'Fenshaw' -- "that you would talk to Mr Jannati about their relationship.  You did no such thing."</p>
<p>Davey didn't say nothing, just sat there.  This looked like deep shit, but the play made no sense.  No-one should give a damn about who said what about whose relationship.  The smiling man continued.</p>
<p>"Later that evening you told Miss Featherstone that you did speak to Mr Jannati and you thought the two of them would 'get along fine'."  The smiling man looked up from his notes and cocked his head at Davey.  "Is that right?"</p>
<p>Davey looked the smiling man in the eyes and said nothing.  The man sighed.</p>
<p>"Touch the bottom of your jacket's left lapel, Mr Hamm.  Squeeze it for me."</p>
<p>Running his fingers down the soft leather he found something round and hard, around the size and thickness of a Polo mint.  It was a wire.</p>
<p>"The typing pool has been very busy with transcribing all of your conversations for the last few months, Mr Hamm.  The things you've said, the things you've promised and to whom have made for very interesting reading."  The smiling man gestured at the thick sheaf of paper in front of him, then met Davey's eyes again.  "As has the things you haven't said.  And the things other people haven't said, that you have said they have."</p>
<p>Davey's bladder turned to ice.  Nicky, he thought, I hope you've scarpered.  I hope you're where this weird bastard can't get you.</p>
<p>The smiling man leaned forwards, his head still cocked to one side.</p>
<p>"Mr Hamm," he breathed, dribbling green that flowed towards Davey across the table, "This 'weird bastard' has everything he wants, right here."</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
