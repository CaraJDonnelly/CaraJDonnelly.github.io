<p>The psychic hackers learnt Portuguese, and things got much worse.</p>
<p>The problems started in Germany, in September 1992, the penultimate September.  That was the last September that Usenet -- the well-spoken predecessor of the World Wide Web -- was pristine and privileged, accessible only to those who attended well-funded universities and even then only those of a certain mindset; it was clean, it was intelligent, it was <em>polite</em>.  Next year AOL would throw open the doors to anyone who could receive advertising materials by mail and tens of thousands of new users would flood online and sully the bitstream with their presence.  Gerhard Fuchs had just begun his fourth year studying at Kaiserslautern University of Technology, was an avid user of Usenet, and had just begun to learn about information security -- in particular, he began to learn about the Man In The Middle attack.</p>
<p>There are many ways to lose control of personal information you would prefer to keep control over; many ways to allow malicious people to violate your privacy. The Evil Maid attack, for instance, where someone enters your hotel room and installs a bug inside your laptop.  Phishing, where you pretend to be someone's bank and ask them for their login details.  Unicast Floods, where you send a network a large message addressed to everyone and it chokes itself trying to deliver it.  Or the social engineering approach, where they get you drunk and ask you questions in a bar.</p>
<p>That one always gets you something good.  Drunk, if nothing else.  Drunk on expenses.</p>
<p>The Man In The Middle attack is an old one, but a gold one.  Sir Francis Walsingham used it in 1585 to obtain enough evidence to sentence Mary, Queen of Scots to execution.  It works like this: say I want to talk to Mary, who is in my opinion the rightful Queen of Britain.  I pop a sealed, ciphered letter in the postbox and I await my Queen's response.  But you, who control the Post Office, are opening my letters, reading them, and maybe adding sentences like "Oh, your Majesty, don't you think we should kill Queen Elizabeth?  Please write back saying yes, and giving a list of nobles who would likely aid in such an assassination.".  I, your humble letter-writer, am none the wiser, because any time Queen Mary does write me a letter containing a list of disloyal nobles, you, the Post Office, tear it up and write out a new one without any incriminating information so that I find nothing amiss.  This, or something like this, is just what happened to Mary, Queen of Scots: her mailman, the forger Thomas Phelippes, was passing her treasonous letters straight to the loyal Sir Francis, and eventually she lost her head because of it.</p>
<p>Gerhard Fuchs loved the elegance of the Man In The Middle attack.  It appealed to his sense that achievement should be a feedback loop, that once someone has gained something then they should use it to the hilt -- in the example above, whoever has gained control of the Post Office should use their achievements to help them achieve even more -- by blackmailing criminals, for example, or losing the leaflets that unpleasant political parties have sent out.  Not for evil, of course, just for effective good, as a moral duty.</p>
<p>Gerhard first realised that he was psychic because of Nadine and Tomas.  Nadine and Tomas were Gerhard's housemates -- together they lived in a thin-walled terraced house of a design popular with every construction agency in Europe since the 1960s, where they drew pictures in charcoal on A3 sheets of high-quality paper and occasionally smoked weed.  Nadine and Tomas had gotten together last semester and were very much in love; Gerhard would hear them, all the way from his bedroom, sitting on the grey living room sofa and whispering nice and occasionally sexual things to one another whilst watching films.  After spending several months experimenting with turning up his stereo and putting earplugs in to his ears, he heard them begin to converse about him:</p>
<p>"Gerhard gets in the way," whispered Nadine, her voice low like the humming of a cello.</p>
<p>"We could ask Gerhard to leave," whispered Tomas in response.  His voice was closer to that of a viol, a now-rare instrument favoured by Bach.</p>
<p>"I'll suggest it to you tomorrow when he's out," whispered Nadine.  Thrumm-thrumm.</p>
<p>"I love you," whispered Tomas in response.  Humm-humm.</p>
<p>Gerhard was stung, and rolled up into a sitting position on his narrow wide-sprung bed.  They were talking about getting rid of him, him!, the perfect housemate, and not even trying to conceal that fact from him, instead whispering it loudly over Bis ans Ende der Welt in their own living room.  He sat up from his bed, stepped to the window, and flung open his muted green curtains to reveal the sodium streetlamps below.  Nadine would suggest it to Tomas tomorrow while Gerhard was out.</p>
<p>While he, Gerhard, was out?</p>
<p>It was only the three of them living there, Gerhard, Nadine and Tomas.  Three students, sharing food and sharing the rent.  Nadine suggesting to Tomas tomorrow that Gerhard move out while Gerhard was out made no sense -- Nadine had just suggested it to Tomas now, while Gerhard was still at home.  There was no need to suggest it again.  He pulled on his jeans and a black t-shirt and headed down the narrow steps to the living room.</p>
<p>Nadine and Tomas were curled up together on the grey sofa, and looked up when he came in.  On the blue-tinted TV screen a hitch-hiker was pointing a awkwardly-shaped device at an elderly man.</p>
<p>"How's it going?" Gerhard asked, standing in the doorway.  He leaned back awkwardly against the wooden door-frame that was the boundary of the green leather wallpaper; the room appeared to have been stitched together from parts taken from a rich person's library.  The occasional table was<br />
solid oak, far too large, and had its legs cut off at the knees.  Had it been any taller it would have dominated the room; as it was it simply made moving around inconvenient.</p>
<p>"Good," said Nadine, and both Nadine and Tomas smiled in unison at Gerhard, like twin cats from a book by Akif Pirinçci.  Then, while Gerhard was looking straight at him, Nadine whispered to Tomas without moving her lips.</p>
<p>"I'd be sorry to see him go," she whispered.</p>
<p>"He's always been patient with us taking up the living room in the evenings," he whispered back.  Gerhard stared at him.  Tomas had not moved his lips either.</p>
<p>This was strange.  Nadine had taken him to see a ventriloquist at the travelling carnival when he had first moved in, before Tomas had joined them, and the man had been able to make the grotesque grinning puppet recite fast poems and even sing -- but it made no sense for his friends to have been practising, nor, if they had been practising ventriloquy, for them to reveal it like this.  He realised that he had been staring at Tomas' lips for far too long.</p>
<p>"I'm going up to bed."  Gerhard said abruptly.  "Goodnight."</p>
<p>He turned away from the patchwork living room and quickly walked back up the sideways-slanted wooden-top stairs to the landing outside his bedroom.  He frowned a private frown.  He had never minded the whispering so far; in fact he had quietly enjoyed the fact that the house was not empty and that there were good companions always within reach, although it had been a surprise when Nadine and Tomas had become romantically involved with one another.  The walls were not thick, but the toilet flushed well and the kitchen had gas hobs.  He would be sad to move out, in fact.</p>
<p>He resolved to pay careful attention to the situation.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>A month later winter had come, the undergraduate students were gone from the city, and Gerhard was walking down a long corridor in the Computer Science department.  The building was suffused with a deep humming that permeated the concrete brick and made the chilly rooms warm, and the wind seemed to be murmuring about dynamic memory allocation, recursive functions and finally getting a working C90 compiler.  It was a department where if someone didn't smile at you in the morning it was because they were so absorbed in and satisfied with their work that they were in reality somewhere else entirely, and only appeared to be present because their bodies were.  Gerhard was happy here; his ideas were listened to and acted upon, and he always felt like the flow of research interests were natural and smooth and matched the flow of his own.</p>
<p>His current project was an extension of the Two Generals problem: two Generals, each in control of a small army, are stationed on either side of a valley containing a powerful enemy.  If the Generals can agree on what time to attack, they will fall upon that enemy and crush them, emerging victorious -- but whenever they send a messenger across the valley, there is a good chance the enemy will intercept the messenger and slaughter them.  How can the Generals ever be certain they will attack at precisely the same time?</p>
<p>The answer is that they cannot ever be sure: if General Antonius sends a messenger to General Barbatio with a time to attack, Antonius does not know if Barbatio got the message.  If Barbatio sends a messenger confirming he got the message, Barbatio does not know that Antonius got the confirmation.  If Antonius sends a messenger confirming that he got the confirmation... there is no way to be certain.</p>
<p>Gerhard's thin dissertation supervisor, Ernst Straud, had proposed a novel exploration of the Two Generals problem via iterated connectionism -- which is to say, he had proposed investigating: given two artificial neural networks and some unreliable conduit of communication between them, under what circumstances were the protocols for deciding synchronisation stable?  To put it another way, how do two people attempting to converse in a dark and noisy room decide whether or not their partner has heard them and replied?  Once more, in plain German: how do you know you aren't being lied to?  The research was nearly impossible, which made it perfect for a Masters student -- one simple result would be enough to send to a conference to provoke discussion, and any result that had provoked discussion at a conference was suitable for submitting as a Masters dissertation.  Ernst's bald pate had a wine-coloured birthmark that suited him as an academic, suggestive of mediocre dinners accompanied by fine port, and he paired this with thin tweed trousers and lightly-checked shirts to give the impression of a man born of whip-trees rather than of big, clumsy humans.</p>
<p>The actual research was finished, Gerhard being an industrious student and Ernst an attentive supervisor, and Gerhard had turned his mind to the pleasantest of academic daydreams: the "Future Work" section.  No-one academic ever completes their Future Work; students graduate, postdoctoral researchers move from post to post, and professors lose interest.  This means that Future Work sections are always full of wild fantasies involving a hundredfold increase in available computing power, sudden advances in your comprehension of your own work, and the marvellous appearance of a younger student willing to do all of the work for you.  They are a true pleasure to read.</p>
<p>Gerhard's Future Work section suggested the addition of a Man in the Middle to the Two Generals.  Usually, the Two Generals problem is supplemented by the addition of a Third and Fourth General, all Generals trying to communicate and agree on some basic fact such as the time of day -- but by adding a Man in the Middle, Gerhard speculated one could prove rigorously that no stable two-layer solutions existed for the Two Generals (plus Traitorous Messenger) problem.  In a paragraph that quoted both Miguel Cervantes and Inger Nilsson he claimed that not only could there be no trusted communication with a known Man In The Middle, but that there could be provably no believably trusted communication.  To put it another way, if you're sitting in a pub and a jerk you don't like is sitting between you and your attractive new friend, there is nothing that you will hear that will convince you that things wouldn't be better if that jerk didn't leave, quickly.  Once more, in plain German: liars will drive you crazy.</p>
<p>It is not provably impossible to mark anyone down for having an overly-ambitious Future Work section.  But it is widely conjectured to be impossible.</p>
<p>"Well done, my boy," said Ernst, and Gerhard swelled with pride.</p>
<p>The meeting complete, he wandered out back into the corridor, heading slowly down the concrete-and-cheap-wood corridor painted in bright colours and tracing a slow path towards the cafeteria.  The humming of the immense computers in the basement had clarified recently, to the point where Gerhard fancied he could actually hear the code speaking to him.  It was a fancy only, he knew.</p>
<p>...but he had started to hear the whispers from Nadine and Tomas louder and clearer ever since that night, and he was no longer able to confidently say that he was not hearing something real when working in the department.  Yesterday the humming had been a blurry song about breaking things apart into manageable chunks, and Frau Gärtner had indeed been splitting her FORTRAN profiler into modules, smaller code files that were easier to read and edit.</p>
<p>None of it was /useful/, was the problem.  Not because he wanted to use any of the things that he had almost convinced himself that he had heard, but because things that weren't useful weren't things he could make testable predictions about.  He had taken a pad and paper and made copious notes of everything he had heard, one morning last week, and succeeded in writing out a few fiery paragraphs arguing that monolithic kernel design was a throwback to the 1970s.  But who would care about such an argument?  No-one would find them coherent and it was certainly no validation of him as a psychic.</p>
<p>In the cafeteria a small cup of awful coffee that tasted worse than battery acid could be purchased for an expensive 90 pfennig and then enjoyed by sitting at one of several long tables of the style that folded and retracted into themselves for easy storage at night, each seat in front of the table permanently attached by a complex hinge.  Gerhard purchased such a cup of expensive and awful coffee and joined Anna and Maria at one of the long, low tables.  Anna had been a teaching assistant for some of Gerhard's undergraduate classes; today was the day of her Disputation, her defence of her Doktorarbeit.</p>
<p>"How did it go?" Gerhard asked.  Her Disputation had been scheduled to start at 10AM; hardworking academics start at 6AM, and lazy academics start at 10AM -- but no-one starts their work at 9AM, when lectures would fall during term-time.  Anna was not looking up at him, instead staring at two paper cups in front of her, one empty, the other still half full of awful coffee.</p>
<p>"It's still going on," answered Maria, quietly.  "Her examiners called a break for lunch."</p>
<p>Anna shook her head slowly, as though trying to shake off a heavy ghost, never taking her eyes away from her three-quarters drunk coffee.  They sat there in silence watching their friend while trying to appear not to stare.  Thorough Disputations usually take around two and a half hours.  To have broken for lunch after three hours suggested that the examiners were not happy at all, and that there would be at least another two hours of painful interrogation in the afternoon.  Disputations should normally be a formality, with your supervisor guiding your work to be of sufficient quality -- an examination that was not a pure formality meant failure was more than likely.  Four years of work could be deemed to be worth nothing.</p>
<p>"I've heard it can go across entire days," said Gerhard without thinking.  Anna jerked her eyes up to look at him, then immediately pulled them back to stare at her coffee cups, her eyes suddenly brimming with tears.  Maria kicked him hard under the table and he felt his face burn red after realising what he had just said.  He opened his mouth to apologise and Maria kicked him again, even harder.</p>
<p>Anna began speaking very, very clearly, her lips not moving at all.</p>
<p>"Hör' mein Bitten, Herr, neige dich zu mir, auf deines Kindes Stimme habe Acht..."</p>
<p>She was barely breathing, her eyes gone blank.  Gerhard looked at Maria and found her staring accusingly at him, clearly not aware of Anna's prayer.  He winced and nodded, and quickly went up to the counter to buy Anna a piece of overpriced coconut cake by way of apology and distraction.  Across the noisy cafeteria he could hear her silent voice wavering in strength as every new repetition was enunciated with desperate precision.</p>
<p>"...auf deines Kindes Stimme habe Acht; auf deines Kindes Stimme habe Acht..."</p>
<p>"You're not alone," he interrupted, and gently touched her shoulder.  He set the apology cake down in front of her.  She looked up at him, confused, then nodded, the tension in her back visibly relaxing.  She smiled wanly at the cake and applied herself to both it and her remaining awful coffee.</p>
<p>When she had finally gone on to the next part of her Disputation both Maria and Gerhard breathed out.</p>
<p>"Du bist ein Dummkopf, Gerhard," said Maria easily, and he nodded.</p>
<p>That evening, he stood at his bedroom window, staring out through the clingfilm-covered glass at the bright stars in the night sky.  Down below in the patchwork living room he could hear Nadine and Tomas whisper sweet nothings to one another.  He no longer believed he was imagining the things that he could hear.  Today, he had heard Anna more clearly than anyone else he had ever heard.  But why?</p>
