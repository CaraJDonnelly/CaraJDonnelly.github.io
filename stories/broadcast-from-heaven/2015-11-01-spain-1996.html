<p>The psychic hackers learnt Portuguese in 1999, and no-one was able to stand against them.</p>
<p>The problems had started in Spain, in Madrid, early April, 1996.  Doctor Maria Pilar Etxarte strode down the off-white corridors of the Hospital Santa Cristina.  Her next ward round -- with her difficult students -- was in three hours, and she had two meetings and one specialist consultation to take care of, and lunch was not on the agenda.  She flagged down one of the junior nurses heading in to a break room.</p>
<p>"Sara," Doctor Etxarte said. "Are you making coffee?  Could you make me a cup as well?  Thank you."  The nurse, Sara Cárdenas, bobbed her head deferentially and ducked into the break room without saying anything.  Etxarte frowned.  She had been a military doctor, a Captain in the OLF, the Operational Logistic Force, and she expected a similar standard of discipline from her civilian colleagues.</p>
<p>The specialist consultation was next.  A British man, yet to regain consciousness, around forty, his skin pale in the early afternoon sunlight.  Most doctors, when not on emergency rotations like those for A&amp;E, would take at least a thirty minute siesta before lunch, as the midday heat in Madrid in April was enough to kill small insects outright, but Doctor Etxarte knew that Serzano-Hernandez from the Comisión Permanente de Aseguramiento, the Permanent Committee of Insurance, requested a summary of all patient pathways at the major hospitals so she could notice, well before it became apparent to anyone else, which doctors saw the most patients in a day, and who would therefore be skilled at running large departments.  She would make do without the sleep.</p>
<p>Maria knew this about Serzano-Hernandez because she could hear what people thought about each other.  It made her a good doctor.  Had she gone straight into civilian service she would be trapped as a GP, a family doctor, but with military experience she got proper hospital work.  It was one thing her mother had never been able to throw in her face.</p>
<p>The trouble with making a diagnosis is that people are liars.  People play down their problems, or exaggerate them, or have been living with a particular pain for so long they don't know what normal is any more.  Being able to hear their thoughts -- or the thoughts of their family about them and how sick they really were -- meant that she didn't have to rely on working out how each new patient, each new complete stranger, was lying to her, but that she could just cut straight through after a few questions and get to the truth.</p>
<p>The British man was someone with connections, but not good ones.  He had been caught in a fire in a café several days before, an arson attack in broad daylight, along with six other people.  At least one of the six, Doctor Etxarte knew, had injuries much more severe, but this man had been scheduled in her consultation slot for the day.  This was why it was obvious he had connections.</p>
<p>She leafed through his notes.  Nicholas Hamm, third-degree burns with 15% coverage, including the hands and face, with known inhalation injury.  The arson attack had been a thrown petrol bomb, and he had just been in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
<p>"Javier," she said, addressing one of the nurses on the ward.  "This man has private insurance.  When you get a moment, move him to the clinic downstairs."</p>
<p>Javier looked up from his paperwork at the desk at the entranceway to the ward and nodded.  "Sure, doctor.  I'll get to him this afternoon."  He looked back down to his paperwork.</p>
<p>"First thing, please."  Maria kept her eyes on Javier until he looked up again to meet her eyes.  Annoyed, he nodded, and she nodded back, satisfied he would actually do what he said rather than claim she had never asked him later.</p>
<p>Maria updated the unconscious man's notes, checking the initial diagnosis and copying it verbatim below before signing her name.  The other doctors on the ward thought her strange for doing this, but she was confident that whoever administrator at the hospital was collecting the statistics that were being fed back to Serzano-Hernandez wasn't qualified to judge whether the notes said anything worth saying, only to note that such-and-such a doctor had seen <em>this</em> many patients this week.  The other doctors weren't aware of Serzano-Hernandez' scrutiny, and her checking over all the diagnoses in the ward had more than once found a serious mistake before it became a problem.  Then something caught her eye.  She leant over and very carefully sniffed his breath.</p>
<p>"Javier?" she called out, then fell silent.  Javier looked up from his paperwork again.</p>
<p>"Yes, doctor?"</p>
<p>"Oh." Maria hesitated, then shook her head.  "This man, Nicholas Hamm, have we contacted his family?"</p>
<p>"No, doctor.  We don't have any family on record for him."</p>
<p>Maria stood looking at the unconscious man, Nicholas Hamm, for a long moment.</p>
<p>She had never seen anyone who breathed out pale yellow smoke while they were unconscious before.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Three days later, Nicholas Hamm regained consciousness in the private ward in the Hospital Santa Cristina, unable to speak and barely able to move.  Maria arrived some fifteen minutes later, having been asked to be informed when this happened.</p>
<p>No-one else could hear people's thoughts.  She knew this, because she had spent the first few years after she gained her gift looking for others like her and found nothing.  She had asked for a second opinion on Nicholas Hamm's breathing from Doctor Guadarrama when they had brought him down to the private clinic on the first floor, and watched for his reaction as he held up a small mirror that was fogged by yellow smoke.  He showed absolutely no reaction to Mr. Hamm's colourful breath.</p>
<p>Right now Mr. Hamm was very slowly and carefully taking sips of water through a straw, from a glass held by one of the private ward's nurses.  She stared at his eyes.  They were dark brown, and promised a quick intelligence.</p>
<p><em>Who are you, Mr Hamm?</em>  She frowned.</p>
<p>He jerked as though stung and looked straight at her.  He choked on his water, thick yellow smoke spat out of his nostrils, and she stepped back, stepped back again, turned and strode out of the ward.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Nicky Hamm felt like shit, he couldn't move his hands or face, and some bird had just shouted in Spanish inside his head.</p>
<p><em>I fucking hate Spain</em>, he thought.  <em>Wish Davey was here.</em></p>
<p>---</p>
<p><em>He heard me. </em> She thought.  <em>He heard me.</em></p>
<p>She remembered the army seminar on <em>management</em> versus <em>leadership</em>.  Management is getting the most out of people at a sustainable level long-term, and leadership is getting the most out of people now, exhausting them to achieve a particular goal.  Maria focused on the techniques for thinking as a manager rather than a leader: list long term goals, then think of how the short-term situation fits into those long-term goals.  Always look far forward.</p>
<p>Goal: be promoted to running this hospital.</p>
<p>Goal: keep the fact that she can hear people's thoughts secret.</p>
<p>As she saw it, she had two options:</p>
<p>Option one: avoid Nicholas Hamm and continue her life as normal.  No-one would believe him if he claimed to have heard her thoughts, and to her knowledge he didn't even know her name.  At the moment he couldn't even speak.</p>
<p>Option two: smother him with a pillow while he slept, just in case he talked and someone listened.  If he was like her, he was good at knowing what words to use to make people believe him, so it was likely he could convince people of anything he wanted.</p>
<p>Option two was riskier, a violation of her Hippocratic Oath, and less moral.  Option one it was, then.</p>
<p>"I'm feeling woozy, Javier," she said, pinching the bridge of her nose with her right hand and squeezing her eyes shut.  "I think I should go home."</p>
<p>Javier blinked, and she could hear him thinking about how she never went home sick.  His train of thought switched to a brief description of how she looked -- <em>h</em>/ -- and she deliberately stumbled to one side -- <em>poor balance, looks like 'flu?</em> -- to seal the impression.  People stunk at seeing liars.</p>
<p>"Sure thing, doctor," she heard Javier say, and she set off slowly to the ward exit and then to the front of the hospital.  As soon as she was a full corridor out of Javier's sight she straightened up and started striding quickly onwards, careful to keep a tired, strained expression on her face.  It was the time of day again where most people were coming back in from their early afternoon siesta, the sun having dimmed just enough for the heat to be bearable, and so she made slow progress against the stream of people returning to work.</p>
<p>She <em>was</em> tired, truth be told.  Siestas aren't easy to skip, when the sun gets so hot and the air gets so heavy.  Maria nodded to one of the blood lab technicians and walked into the lobby.  She blinked, and stopped.</p>
<p><em>What was Nicholas Hamm doing out of bed so soon?</em></p>
<p>---</p>
<p><em>¿Por qué fue Nicholas Hamm caminando tan pronto?</em></p>
<p>Davey flinched, violently, and tried to stop his heart racing.  <em>I'm going mad,</em> he thought.  <em>I don't speak Spanish.</em></p>
<p>"Is there a problem, Mr Hamm?" asked Pershore, his ever-present smile a little wider than usual.  Davey flinched again and spoke as quickly as he could.</p>
<p>"I don't speak Spanish, Mr Pershore," he said.  "So I realised I wouldn't be able to ask the front desk about..." he swallowed, his mouth dry. "About my brother."</p>
<p>Pershore's glassy eyes stared at him -- Davey still didn't get the feeling like there was anyone really behind there, this nut in the white suit with white gloves and a <em>cane</em>, for fuck's sake, dressed like he was on fucking <em>safari</em>, and if anything went wrong it was all on his head and people back home would start dying as punishment...</p>
<p>Pershore's smile widened enough to show some perfect white teeth.  "Quite so, Mr Hamm."  He stepped forward and began to speak with the hotel front desk in flawless Spanish, leaning over the front desk like he wanted the bird on the other side to think he was a charmer.</p>
<p><em>Eso no es Nicholas Hamm.</em>  He flinched again.  <em>¿Puedes escucharme?</em>  He shook his head sharply.</p>
<p>The flow of Spanish from Pershore stopped.  He slowly straightened up and, with great precision, turned on the balls of his feet to regard Davey.  "What is wrong, Mr Hamm?"</p>
<p>"Nuffin', sir."  The honorific slipped out, and the slimy bastard's eyes actually lit up a little.  <em>I know my place,</em> Davey thought, thinking of that Ronnie Corbett sketch, and he forced what should have been a terrified giggle into a sheepish smile.</p>
<p>"Very good, Mr Hamm."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Maria Pilar Etxarte hurried down the long hospital corridors.  The strange man -- that had looked just like the other man, Hamm, who had heard her -- had heard her too.  Twin brothers that could hear her thoughts like she could hear other people's thoughts, but who both seemed surprised at this fact.</p>
<p>She exasperatedly waved her hand through a cloud of pale yellow smoke that was floating near the centre of the corridor.  It swirled and juddered, but did not dissipate.  As she rounded a corner, she saw that the pale yellow smoke already extended in front of her all the way down the next corridor.</p>
<p>She followed it, stopping only at a store cupboard to pick up the necessary equipment, all the way to the private clinic where Nicholas Hamm was recuperating.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>"La clínica privada?" Mr Pershore smiled.  "Usted es una maravilla y una delicia."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The clinic ward was still empty after the day's siesta, with only one nurse stationed near the door.  The clinic itself was a long L-shaped room, with thin plasterboard panelling providing permanent privacy between patients; since everyone here was paying, they could summon iced water or fruit juice if they wished by pressing a button that would light up a dashboard at the nurse's station.  She nodded to the nurse on duty and walked quickly to the bed where Nicholas Hamm lay sleeping.</p>
<p>She uncapped the bottle of liquid sodium thiopental.  Nicholas Hamm was around 100kg, so a 20mg/kg dose was two whole grams.  The bottle she was holding was 2.5% solution, so that was around 100mL for a sure-fire lethal dose if he had been healthy.  With severe burns three syringes -- 60ml -- would either kill him or knock him out so cold he wouldn't be able to tell those men anything about her before she got a chance to try again.</p>
<p>She was Maria Pilar Etxarte.  She was going to run this hospital someday soon.  No-one could know about her curse of hearing other people's thoughts.  She was a Spanish citizen like anyone else.  It was not a good time to have a Vasco name in Madrid.  The man in the lobby had not turned to look at her, did not know her face, did not know her name, and no-one was going to turn up and take her life away from her.  She had worked long and hard to become a doctor.</p>
<p>Nicholas Hamm, the burned and pale Englishman, opened his eyes.  They were dark brown, more focused than before, and Maria could see the colour in his breath was thicker and darker yellow.  He didn't move -- couldn't cry out, because of the petrol inhalation -- but also he didn't move to press the call button for the nurse.  He looked frightened, like he was about to burst into tears, and it was clear he knew exactly why she had come.  She looked at the syringe in her hand.</p>
<p>She had worked long and hard to become a doctor.</p>
<p>She lowered the syringe.  A look of sad relief blossomed on the sick man's face, and the pale yellow smoke he was exhaling that was flowing towards her connecting the two of them was joined by a burst of blue, spreading out and entwining itself with the pale cloud of smoke between them.</p>
<p>"Your brother is here to visit you, Se<span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="es"><span class="hps">ñor</span></span> Hamm."  She hesitated.  There is nothing appropriate to say after someone has just watched you decide not to murder them.  "My apologies for disturbing you."</p>
<p>His eyes opened wide and she heard his thoughts pick up into overdrive, a yammering and insistent train of panic.  He opened his mouth to try to speak, but nothing came out.  His eyes filled with tears at pain from the effort.  She raised her free hand to quiet him.</p>
<p>"Do you speak Spanish?" she asked.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>"Think in Spanish."</p>
<p>He blinked, then knitted his brows and frowned with concentration.  His thoughts dropped away to near silence.  She clarified:</p>
<p>"Think in Spanish about your brother."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><em>Mi hermano captado ... la policía.  No, fuck.  Mi hermano entendio la policía?  La policia daño -- hará daño -- mi hermano?  La policia hará daño mi hermano.</em></p>
<p>He looked her in the eye and thought as loudly and with as much feeling as he could.</p>
<p><em>¡Por favor! ¿Me puede decir dónde está la estación de autobuses?</em></p>
<p>---</p>
<p>"Nah, Mr Pershore, the lady at the desk said this way."  Davey stood his ground, and pointed down the wrong corridor.  He'd been doing this for about fifteen minutes, now, and he didn't need to look up to meet Pershore's eyes to know that that bastard's weird little smile was more of a forced grimace at the moment.  <em>This is the way she said</em>, he repeated internally for Pershore's benefit, and began to slouch off down the wrong corridor.</p>
<p>His connection to Nicky was one of them things they'd never really talked about with each other since they were five, six years old, when they'd started getting told off for telling lies.  The colours between them was just like any of the colours he saw between everyone else, but brighter, and while most people's colours didn't change except while they were talking to each other, because why would they, right, because you had to be talking to someone for their feelings about you to change.  But for Nicky he could remember that time when he was fifteen and he'd been seeing Sandra behind Nicky's back, and he'd known when Nicky had found out because suddenly out of nowhere there was this big red cloud of smoke coming right towards him across the playground, and he'd known Nicky was going to kick the shit out of him so he scarpered, and he could see when he was running that he was huffing out this big yellow cloud of fear so there was no hope Nicky wouldn't know where he was hiding.  So Nicky had known he was afraid and known where to find him.</p>
<p>Now Davey knew Nicky was afraid, afraid of <em>him</em>, and he knew where to find him too, by the wisps of thick yellow smoke drifting down the corridor towards him, the wisps of smoke he'd been silently trying to avoid.  He'd gotten good at not thinking about Nicky too much, the harder for that bastard Pershore to listen in, but the truth was...</p>
<p><em>I really don't want them to get you, Nicky, mate.</em></p>
<p>"Tough shit, Mr Hamm," enunciated Pershore with relish.  "Lead on."</p>
<p>And Davey led on, walking slowly down the wrong corridor, hoping something would turn up.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><em>Los objetivos a largo plazo,</em> she was thinking, loud enough to hurt his head.  <em>Los objetivos a largo plazo.</em></p>
<p>Nicky Hamm did not want to die.  He'd never really thought about it before, but he really, strongly, did not want to die.  About ten years ago he'd gone bareknuckle against Jack Brown in a room full of pistols, the Brown's stockroom.  Both of them were trying to knock the other down long enough to pick up a gun to blow the other one's head off, but Nicky had never really stopped to feel afraid.  He'd been too busy to feel afraid.  He didn't want to die in some fucking hospital in Spain, or locked up by some bent copper going off his own script.</p>
<p>He thought about Mickey Baker, the photographer that had gone missing a week after Davey had got nicked.  He'd never seen the bloke in the suit that had left Scotland Yard with Davey in cuffs before, and had said he'd ask a few questions, then he'd just vanished.  The boys had mostly stayed where they were in London, done a quiet overnight clean-out of the shipping company so only the legit stuff was left, with Nicky getting out and a few others that were definitely dirty getting out too, and a few others that were definitely clean taking sudden holidays, just to piss up the trail a bit.  Mickey had been alright -- mostly cared about photos and stories.  And no-one at the nick would even admit that Davey had been taken in.  It smelled bad.  It smelled like a hit.  He'd bet his life Mickey was dead.  And Davey turning up here, against all their plans... that weren't his twin brother.  He could see the colours coming off Davey now, and they weren't good ones.</p>
<p>He didn't want his life to end in some hospital bed in Spain, alone except for a monthly phone box call from home.</p>
<p><em>Por favor. Mi amigo está muerto.</em></p>
<p>---</p>
<p><em>Long term goals</em>, she thought.  <em>Long term goals.</em></p>
<p>She did not want to kill this man: that conflicted with her long-term goal of being a doctor.  She did not want him to be captured: if he talked about her her secret would be out and her career ruined, and if she did not help him to escape he had no reason not to talk about her to the authorities.  She could not abandon him in Madrid: if he died that was killing him, if he did not die then he, as a badly-injured Englishman who could not speak because of petrol inhalation, would be brought back to a hospital and then captured.</p>
<p><em>Please</em>, he thought, aiming the broken Spanish words at her.  <em>My friend is dead.</em></p>
<p>She took up her syringe again and drew out 3ml of sodium thiopental.  She took his arm in her hand and found a vein.  She injected the barbiturates smoothly.  They would last for around ten minutes.</p>
<p>"Wait here," she said.  She walked quickly and quietly across the ward to collect a wheelchair, and just as quickly and quietly back to his bed.  Once he was in the chair she walked to the furthest bed in the ward where an elderly man was asleep, pressed the call button for the nurse on his bedside panel, and walked back to the bed of Nicholas Hamm.  When the duty nurse passed by in front of them she simply walked them both out of the ward and into the corridor.</p>
<p><em>Right, </em>she heard him think, woozily.</p>
<p>Javier would say she had gone home before Nicholas Hamm was found to be missing.  If she could leave the hospital without anyone seeing --</p>
<p><strong><em>Turn right!</em></strong></p>
<p>She spun the wheelchair into a sharp right turn, almost sending it straight into a row of hospital beds.  Before she could stop herself, she looked over her left shoulder -- straight into the haunted eyes of Nicholas Hamm's twin brother.  Before she recovered from the surprise long enough to think, he had walked on past, his expression never changing by a fraction.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Davey breathed out a silent sigh of relief as the yellow cloud of fear coming from Nicky was no longer coming in front of him but behind him.  He was on the move.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The afternoon sunlight outside the Hospital Santa Cristina was golden and not overly hot.  In Doctor Maria Pilar Etxarte's pocket was the bottle of stolen barbiturates, which would shortly be missed from the store cupboard.  In front of her, in a wheelchair, was a fugitive who could hear her thoughts and whose thoughts she could hear, who would shortly be missed from his bed.  She did not want this, this morning, this life.  Her life she was angling at Serzano-Hernandez and his quiet recruitment of excellent doctors.  This man and his brother were not going to turn up and take away her life, and there was one thing of which she was very certain.</p>
<p><em>Come hell or high water, carajo, I am turning up to work tomorrow.</em></p>
