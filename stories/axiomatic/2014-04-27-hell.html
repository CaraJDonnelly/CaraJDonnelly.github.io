<p>(Axiom: You are absolutely certain that you are going to hell.)</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>“There's no doubt about it,” with relish, delivered by Professor Greys, the sound disappearing into the empty labs. “These rats are going to hell.”</p>
<p>It was scientifically proven; statistically significant. This batch of rats had that characteristic haemoglobin which reacted so delightfully to a magnetic field - just a tad more deflected than theory predicted. Rats going to heaven deflected the same tad less – consistently. If a rat bit, fought and scratched its way through life (even if put in situations requiring those reactions), it would go to hell.</p>
<p>Hell, of course, is a vague concept. Greys had been working on remote magnetic encephalography for a government which hadn't yet decided that mind-reading was a stupid pipe dream. The programmers had grandly proclaimed a new version of the code that would give perfect readings on all rat emotions (rats being the test subjects), the engineers had upped the sensitivity on the readers without compromising accuracy, and the backers had signed another check.</p>
<p>Of the three, the engineers were to blame for the discovery. Rat Adam, posthumously named, had been electrocuted by poor wiring. Station Three had been shut down for the day and data from it ignored, until Simon (beautiful Simon) had brought it to her attention. In the milliseconds around the death, there had been an exponential dip in amplitude (brain-death), followed by a sudden peak from the pleasure centre of the brain.</p>
<p>The programmers had been lambasted. They rolled back to the previous version of the code and, with much ceremony, a second rat (named Evan, posthumously) was injected with an overdose of painkillers. Amplitude dipped – and then peaked, as before, but this time with a signature of agony. The same anomalous behaviour on every station, on every version of the code.</p>
<p>Discussion followed. Experiment followed discussion. Detected in each rat killed was an enormous peak of pleasure or pain immediately following the expected dip in amplitude. 'Enormous' was a poor description – 'approaching unimaginable' was better. The bloodwork of each rat (after months of fruitless search) revealed this sensitivity to a magnetic field – so slight, but consistent. A little marker noting whether a rat would 'feel' Heaven or Hell in the final moment after expiring. Three months of repetition had done little but confirm the original conjectures.</p>
<p>Greys set down the results from the latest samples (another 10 data points, another decimal place) and picked up the final folder, the labs empty after the PhD students scuttled home at 5:00pm. Rats are a fantastic approximant for humans in almost every way; she wanted to peek at her own destiny. A page, turned.</p>
<p>A deflection, digested.</p>
<p>A frown.</p>
<p>Approximations, of course, contain errors – by definition. A comparison was needed – a comparison which could easily be obtained from the local church. A short walk, a small brick, a blow to the back of the head (without theft, not worth investigating), a needle, and... back into the centrifuge. Two hours (a film by Lewin, watched) later, the two fresh results are printed. The two fresh results, read.</p>
<p>A frown.</p>
<p>Not only did the priest's blood deflect in the opposite direction to her own, but Grey's blood (re-run) was now showing almost double the amount of negative deflection - the bad kind, that is - as before. She scratched above and behind her ear, and wondered at how still that priest had lain, and wondered whether she might not profit from heading back to the church, to check, and, if necessary, hide the body.</p>
<p>A splash in the river. A week before the police are roused to search – a day before the scentcopters locate the product of an accident. A day thence before the home-justice system, voted on by thousands, would sentence Professor Greys, innocent in intent, to death.</p>
<p>Nine days. Eight days of freedom, with her DNA all over the church and body. Nine days before the pain-peak hits. A pain more than a thousand times more excruciating than that which any rat (even under scientifically necessary torture) would feel during its lifetime, all in an instant.</p>
<p>Four days passed. Simon (beautiful, caring Simon) dared to wonder aloud at her lack of care when dealing with the backers – brushing them aside to an assistant, giving them no courtesy. She did not care to explain that the next six months funding was of little import, especially when the damn rats kept dying and going to hell. She tried morphine, LSD, steroids, vitamins – the only thing which had any effect were broccoli and cabbage. Too small, too small. All the sins and virtue of the life of a rat imprinted themselves indelibly upon its blood, their fate standing proud and proclaiming its existence and type..</p>
<p>On the evening of the sixth day – one day before the police were forced to investigate by statute – she brooded at the same lab bench. Station Three. There was no recourse, no more time to think and try, with the labs closing tomorrow to begin refurbishment. Tuesday would be wasted, Wednesday would be imprisonment, and Thursday she would be dead.</p>
<p>Simon coughed, gently, behind her. He said some words. She had been under a lot of stress, he said, and didn't seem to notice the things that the people around her could offer. Cause and effect, he said, and smiled. Cause and effect. She chuckles, and leans back. He puts his arms around her. The professor blinks, and a distance appears in her eyes even as her shoulders relax into Simon's godly abdomen. Cause and effect.</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>A door, smashed. A police boot, stepping over debris. Corporal Tang advancing, shouting warnings to the murderer unseen, trapped in her abode. The priest's body had been found, and all evidence pointed to this residence. Come out, with your hands up, and your mouth open for quik-ident.</p>
<p>Silence. Tang sighed – the bitch had run. Runners caused paperwork, and reduced the reward given to every police officer after solving a crime. Corporal Davis proceeds into the sitting room of the apartment as Tang advances into the kitchen. They regroup. Music, soft and decadent, is emanating from the single bedroom. They enter.</p>
<p>“Shit.”</p>
<p>Tang, hating Davis as he did, felt no urge to respond. The needles, the ropes and the two corpses which signified a generous bonus to the two policemen were acceptable. Run-of-the mill. Most murders and suicide nowadays were fuelled by drugs – although high grade morphine was unusual. The expression of pain, the spilled blood covering the bed, soaking the duvet – these were all within the norm.</p>
<p>The pump. The IV lines, one leading from the blond muscleman (bound to the bed) into the left wrist of the dame, handcuffed (herself, presumably) to the chair in the corner. Another pump, with its line leading to nowhere, the blood from the dame's right wrist having spread across the wooden floor, making a thin puddle to the boundaries of the room, draining her dry. These things were unusual – sickening to a hardened cop used to a very specific kind of depravity. The message daubed on the wall, with the fingertips of the suspect thick with the red she used to write her final words.</p>
<p>“HERE GOES NOTHING.”</p>
