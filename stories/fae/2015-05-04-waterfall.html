<p>Waterfall.  We think of that word as meaning 'a drop in the path of a river', but in truth the word is much grander; it is a Name of the fae.  East of the moon there is the place from where all water comes, and to where all water goes, and where all water falls.  It has no beginning, nor end, though it is easy enough to enter and to leave, since the falling water forms great columns the width of a stormcloud that reach down and up so far that you would grow dizzy trying to see where one column joins or splits from another.  Between these columns is air made fresh with salt.  Any creature leaving the warmth of the columns finds itself floating as though in a gentle breeze, with the water where it had lived all its life rushing on ahead of it.  This is how adventures are started, by a youthful spirit leaving its home column briefly, allowing the gentle breeze to soft its passage downwards for a few moments, then plunging itself back in to a strange land to spend the rest of its life journeying back to its country.</p>
<p>Shell lived in the waterfall, and was the oldest of her clan, old enough to remember wars coming and going, old enough that her children remembered them too.  She got her name, as all true people do, by the first thing in the world she desired for herself: a shell some creature had discarded and left to fall through the water as it would.  She never stopped collecting, and since she was not of the sort to throw things away, nor to ever admit mistakes, she collected very slowly and with great care.</p>
<p>The day I tell you of now is the day Shell finished building her home.  She had spent many, many long moments of her life collecting this and that, odd slivers and strange shards of carapaces from creatures rarely seen, all driven by some design she never shared.  She had bound them together with weeds and magic until she had fashioned herself what looked like an articulated clam, folded over and over, solid in every place but hinged in every other, and all as light as the thinnest shell.  Today her home was complete.</p>
<p>Her clan gathered silently, with her remaining direct children, Silt and Breath, at the head of the crowd.  She looked at them, impassively, and began to swim, dragging her home behind her by her arms.  The clan followed, and she kept swimming.  More came, relations-by-marriage, and she kept swimming.  Some left, with food to catch or young to teach, and she kept swimming.  Her clan, being so old, had long occupied the centre of the column in which they fell, and as it became apparent that she was swimming, dragging her home towards the open air, several adolescents tried to swim close to her to offer their hands in pulling her house.  She clacked her beak at them, and they retreated.</p>
<p>Long moments later she reached the edge.  She looked back to make eye contact with Breath, and they nodded to one another, both far too many moments old for speech.  Waiting no longer she swung herself around and pushed her home out ahead of her.</p>
<p>It dragged her out into the still air and she tumbled for a short moment, unused to the lack of water to push herself against.  Her home caught a momentary breeze and unfurled, snapping open.  She clung to her segmented, mother-of-pearl parachute, and watched the water fall past her, carrying her far, far away, farther away than anyone had ever travelled before.  This was the start of the greatest adventure.</p>
