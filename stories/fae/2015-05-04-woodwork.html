<p>Woodwork.  We think of that as a thing describing wood that has been worked, things like tables and chairs, but actually the word is much older; it is a Name of the fae.  The old forest covered - and still covers - all the land to the West of the mountains to the East, South of the Sun; the trees there were grown so old and strong that their roots interlocked, and as the seasons and years changed they pulled against each other like little strands of muscle in a bicep, flexing the forest this way and that.  The wood /worked/ against the soil, tilling it and keeping the ground beneath the tall trees' roots fresh.</p>
<p>Finn had lived five hundred days West of the mountains for all the days he had lived, which was a long time, and had wanted only to watch the changes that happened in the world.  One day, he saw a fly, a bluebottle, buzz past him going East, and the trees creaked.  A hundred days later he saw another fly, another bluebottle.  He caught it and asked it "From where did you come?".</p>
<p>"From the West," it said, and Finn released it.  The trees creaked again.  Finn began to walk West.</p>
<p>A hundred days West he saw two more bluebottles.  Catching them, he asked "From where did you come?".</p>
<p>"From the West," they said, and Finn released them.  The trees groaned, their roots pulling against one another.  Finn walked West again.</p>
<p>A hundred weeks later he saw five bluebottles.  Catching four of them, two in each hand, he asked them "From where did you come?".</p>
<p>"From the West," they said, and Finn jogged a little way East to release them with the fifth bluebottle.  The trees juddered, the sound of two well-tangled roots slipping past one another like a small earthquake.  Finn walked West again.</p>
<p>A hundred months later he saw a cloud of bluebottles.  Holding his hand up, Finn stopped them in their flight, and he asked them "From where did you come?".</p>
<p>"From the West," they said.  Finn walked slowly around the cloud of bluebottles, and they flew on to the East.</p>
<p>The trees were moving audibly, here, fast and urgent enough that Finn could feel the ground thrum beneath his feet.  The muscle tissue that was the forest was shaking here, faster than he had known in all the days he had lived, which was a long time.</p>
<p>The next day, he came to a clearing, and he saw the whale.</p>
<p>We think of a whale as a creature that lives in the sea, with flippers and eyes bigger than our heads - but this is no more a whale than a tadpole is a frog.  A fully grown whale is the size of a mountain, with ten legs and twelve enormous mouths each the size of a village, mouths that sing in coarse, deep harmony.  The trees surrounding, shorn of their neighbours, were moving as rapidly as a tree can, which is not so very rapid, away from the deep, wide hole that had been opened in the forest.</p>
<p>Down Finn sat.  He began to watch the whale, and the forest retreating.  To my knowledge he sits there still.</p>
