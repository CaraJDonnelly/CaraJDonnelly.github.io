<p>I grew up on those ‘mythology for children’ books, that told the stories of Norse mythology in all their gory details (except for that bit where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ska%C3%B0i#Sk.C3.A1ldskaparm.C3.A1l">Loki ties his figs to a goat</a>), and Wayland the Smith.  I loved <em>Songs of Earth and Power</em> by Greg Bear, far superior to his science fiction, all about the Sidhe and the Urges and the Humans.  More recently, the Sookie Stackhouse novels reminded me of how much I love the stories of these violent, brutal and beautiful races.</p>
<p>The stories below draw from no coherent tradition.</p>
