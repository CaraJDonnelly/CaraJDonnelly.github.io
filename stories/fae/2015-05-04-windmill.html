<p>Windmill.  We think of this as a human invention, a thing that turns the wind into ground corn to keep a village alive, but in truth the word is something much more brutal; it is a Name of the fae. 'Milling' is a military word; it means a style of fighting in which a recruit is not allowed to defend themself.  Two soldiers enter the ring and must attack relentlessly until one is unconscious.  'Windmilling' is the same as regular milling, only your opponent is the wind, and no-one has ever won.</p>
<p>The old Queen had lost her final battle against the wind, and so the crown of the true people passed to her youthful daughter, the new Queen Mistal.  The true people at that time were making their yearly passage to the South and East to the rocky plains, where the desert was marginally cooler during summer.  In the days of which I speak, the true people were divided along blood lines between those that burrowed beneath the sands at night to hide beneath the dunes, laying flat like sandfish, and those that huddled together, sitting like children in a circle facing inwards and interlocking their shoulders to keep out the wind.  These two groups had in the past been violent with one another, and memories of anger are the hardest to forget.</p>
<p>Mistral had an orb that let the ruler of the true people see as much as one year into the future.  By long tradition it was never used, since every wise child knows that what is to be known is easy to know, and what is hidden is usually hidden for a reason by mischevious hands.  But Mistral was dying in her mind.</p>
<p>Jugo, the prince consort, was of those-that-sat during the night, while Mistral and her advisers Foehn and Ostra were of those-that-burrow.  All knew of her affliction; her body would live on, but her mind, her soul and spark, would grow dim and vanish, leaving behind only a golem that wanted only to consume whatever it could.  Those that knew her intimately would see the change, but those that did not would not.  She saw that the true people would split and scatter if they had no firm rule so soon after her mother had died; she could not abdicate.</p>
<p>She sent Ostra scouting to the South, and Jugo ahead to the South and East; Foehn she sent to the East, down the EEEEEEEEEslopes to the regions where the desert grew even hotter.  The three of them were tasked with finding a healer that could save the Queen from her illness.  Alone apart from her subjects, she returned to her tent, the tent of the Queen, and drew back the gold-embroidered velvet cover that lay over the orb of the future.</p>
<p>She saw in the orb her close friends return empty handed; she saw herself, sat upon the throne with no light in her eyes.  She saw the wind blow against her people and her people grow restless and turn upon one another.  She saw herself kill Jugo and Ostra and Foehn as they banded together against the abomination she would become after her spark had guttered out.  She saw those-that-burrow and those-that-sat turn against one another, and both were scattered bloody and divided across the desert.</p>
<p>She called a halt to the true people's trek South and East across the desert, right at the Great Ridge.  As you know, children, the dunes in a desert are not static; the wind batters them and carries the grains from one to the next, so that - were you to sit and watch, as some of the true people did and still do - over the course of the year you would see that the dunes ripple and flow with the prevailing wind, flowing North and West in the autumn and South and East in the spring.  When a dune becomes tall enough then it casts a shadow in the wind, and the grains that would have been stolen from its sheltered face remain, while the grains deposited on its wind-facing face add to the dune's height.  The Great Ridge is such a dune, the height of a hundred people, so large that when the autumn humidity came and the wind struck it the Great Ridge would rumble like a sleeping beast for entire minutes afterwards.</p>
<p>Those-who-sat naturally encamped on the South and East side, sheltered from the wind, while those-that-burrowed naturally encamped on the North and West where the wind would deposit more grains upon them as they slept.</p>
<p>(Here, children, a riddle for you.  The Great Ridge had a peak as sharply asymmetric as that of a water wave about to spill over.  Would those-that-sat be able to shelter in its shadow if it had a smooth and flat peak, and the Sun was dim that day?)</p>
<p>When Jugo returned from the South and East he found those-that-sat engaged in an enormous task.  Mistral met him several miles away from the encampment and bade him circle around.  Together they made a wide detour and climbed the steep face of the Great Ridge far from the eyes of her subjects.  When they crested the summit and were hit full blast by the anabatic gusts Jugo had to blink away the sharp grains from his eyes.  Clearing them, he beheld a strange sight.</p>
<p>Ahead of them, those-that-sat were engaged in the construction of an elaborate death monument in the style reserved for the great heroes of the true people.  They were moving slowly, as though none wished the work to be completed.</p>
<p>Behind them, those-that-burrow were doing the same, and moving with the same slowness.</p>
<p>"Go down into the camp of those-that-burrow and ask them what they are doing." ordered Mistral.</p>
<p>Jugo returned some hours later.  "They are building a monument to those-that-sat in preparation for when they fall upon them and kill them, as you have commanded them to do."</p>
<p>"Are they happy in their task?"</p>
<p>"No.  They say you commanded each of them to prepare a detailed tribute to three of those-that-sat, arranged such that each of those-that-sat have three of those-that-burrow creating a tribute, and everyone is closely related to someone creating a tribute for every one of those-that-sat.  None of them feel that you are right to command them to kill another true person; to cause such a death is the prerogative of the wind alone."</p>
<p>Ostra returned from the South and Foehn from the East, and they attended her in her tent upon the crest of the Great Ridge.  Foehn needed Ostra's help to climb the steep slope.  Mistral asked them the questions she had asked Jugo, and they gave much the same answers for those-that-sat as he had for those-that-burrow.  She nodded, wearily.</p>
<p>The next morning, the true people were woken by the sound of a commotion.  The royal tent had been torn from its supports and was flapping free in the wind.  Queen Mistral was stood proud, in her hand a scimitar, and arrayed against her was Jugo, Foehn and Ostra.  Jugo, one of those-that-burrowed, stood slightly to the South and East of the other two, and was so more visible from the camp of those-that-sat.</p>
<p>The Queen raised her sword and let out a fierce ululation, so loud the Great Ridge began to rumble in sympathy.</p>
<p>"Fall upon them, my people, and destroy them utterly!" she cried, her voice carrying for miles through the humid air.</p>
<p>No-one moved.</p>
<p>Looking into the eyes of her Prince Consort Jugo, she felt her sickness take hold with finality.</p>
<p>"Goodbye," she said, quietly.  Seeing the spark in her die, Jugo plunged his spear into the body of what had used to be his lover.</p>
<p>And so those-that-sat and those-that-burrowed chose not to murder one another.  They continued with their journey South and East without Mistral, who was remembered only in stories to scare naughty young children, and in other stories to scare naughty old councillors.</p>
