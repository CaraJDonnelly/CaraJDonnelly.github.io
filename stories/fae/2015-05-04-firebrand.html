<p>Firebrand.  We think of that as a person who is angry, who inflames the passions of those around them, but the original sense of the word is sharper and more literal; it is a Name of the fae.  On the burning foothills below the Grand Peak the only sensation to be felt is that of differing intensities of heat; from uncomfortably warm to painfully hot.  Those that come to these foothills find themselves bereft of coherent landmarks and thus rarely able to find their ways back to the homes from whence they had come.</p>
<p>Ko was born amongst the licking flames and the lava, and her first action, as is the first action of every true person, was to do nothing.  A broad, thick flame stretched out as though to slap her, then twisted away at the last moment - as flame will do - leaving only only the thinnest of lines down from her forehead to her navel.  This was the first sound of her name, as the fire wrights the name of all true people across their bodies as they live.  Her second action, as was the second action of every true person, was to learn that fire is dangerous and must be avoided.</p>
<p>In twelve flicks of the flame, Ko had grown into Kolenei, each syllable in her name a time when she had become distracted from the here-and-now and stopped moving fast enough, each new mark it had left upon her skin adding a single syllable to the end of her name.  She moved, as all wise ones move, without hesitation and without fear, because fear slows you down and slowing down means you die.  Her closest friend, Panolomei, was younger than she and had learned more slowly than Kolonei, and hence Panolomei's name was longer.</p>
<p>This day, the day of which I now speak, Kolonei saw two old and supple dancers retreat from two gouts of flame; with their backs turned to one another they were each unaware of the other's approach.  Their haste as they rushed backwards towards each other first cooled the air as their motion blew away the flames, then heated it to twice as hot as the air fed it further.  The pair were both badly burned, and a good part of their names written over with the syllable -baa, the suffix that means 'simpleton'.</p>
<p>Kolenei and Panolomei copied the two old fools, first leaping backwards towards each other and then quickly leaping away again so the gout of flame behind them surged fruitlessly.  The fire was not fooled for long and crept off to one side, rushing them both from a single flank that they had to break away and flee - but they regrouped soon enough, and brought more dancers into the rhythm, pushing the flame to where they intended it to lie.  The fire was wily, and split into seven rushing shards all attacking different pairs - so the dancers broke again and fled, regrouping once more with new partners, even ones that had not known Kolenei.  In time the disparate dances that formed spread through the foothills until their rhythms synchronised even at great distances, like the flashing of fireflies on the banks of dark rivers.</p>
<p>The fire is no fool, and does not respect any attempt to chain it.  As it learns, the dance learns too, growing ever more subtle, and the fire only burns those who misstep.  The length of the true people's names are, as before, reflective of the mistakes they have made, but their names are now reflective not only of their own wisdom, but also of their skill at understanding and applying the wisdom of those around them.</p>
