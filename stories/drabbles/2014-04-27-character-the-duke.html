<p>A drabble I wrote as part of directing The Way Through The Woods for Two Shades of Blue. A memory from the perspective of the Duke whose mind would be ruined by the Witch Queen.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>A Duke strides across swept stone floors, his pace self-consciously elongated. Today visits King Edmund; today the old Duke is not alive to greet him; today a young man rises.</p>
<p>Servants scurry in knotted patterns; the West wing is newly complete, fashioned from mixed stone - marble, slate, quartzite and gneiss - and lacks for furnishings.</p>
<p>The Duke hurries over to a group of servants carefully unhooking a gold-threaded tapestry. He barks: "What are you doing? Leave it! The King comes today, and you're hiding my family history? Update it later, later!"</p>
<p>"Today," he mutters, hurrying onwards, "I must shine."</p>
