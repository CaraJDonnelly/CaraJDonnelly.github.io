<p>Gus, bored on the train to work, turned to the guy next to him and spoke.</p>
<p>“I'm Gus. Mind if I ask your name?”</p>
<p>The stranger looked confused. Gus persisted.</p>
<p>“Your name?”</p>
<p>“I'm, er, Death.” Death admitted. The Universe flickered; the carriage chilled significantly.</p>
<p>“You're just a man on a train,” said Gus, “Why would Death appear as just a man on a train?” He frowned. “Am I about to die?”</p>
<p>“No, no,” said Death, “I'm here because being 'Just a man on a train' is a Death of sorts.”</p>
