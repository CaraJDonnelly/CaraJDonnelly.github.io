<p>Angels exist outside of Time, the great branching artwork that splits and splits again. There is a branch where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_butterfly_effect">you chose differently</a>, and one where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_man_in_the_high_castle">the Axis powers won</a>. It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_garden_of_forking_paths">garden of forking paths</a>, and the angels sculpt Time's bleeding edge. When each day is beautiful they add it to the branch.</p>
<p>Today was made in several parts, and Raphael is healing the conflicts. Uriel flutters his strawberry-blond wings and speaks.</p>
<p>"Samyaza is lacking. He creates, but never adds his days to the branch. He dances through the past, neglecting the future."</p>
<p>Raphael nods.</p>
<p>"Commitment issues."</p>
