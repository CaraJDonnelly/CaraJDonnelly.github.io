<p>A drabble I wrote as part of directing The Way Through The Woods for Two Shades of Blue. A memory from the perspective of the Boy who would become her Prince.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>A young boy runs through nameless trees, their smooth trunks leaving narrow avenues down which to slip, the sanctuary of their branches just out of reach.</p>
<p>The raven's cry echoes in his ears, the smell of burnt flesh clings to his clothes. He stumbles over a root, and pauses to catch his breath. The Sun is hidden but lies directly ahead, Southwards, its light dully reflected by pale grey bark.</p>
<p>Somewhere ahead lies safety. Somewhere ahead lies the house with the stories, with the garden, the turnips, the wooden fence, with Mother. Somewhere ahead lies safety.</p>
<p>The boy runs onward.</p>
