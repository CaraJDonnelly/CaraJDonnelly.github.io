<p><em>Author's note: I think this is the stupidest thing I have ever written.</em></p>
<p>(SCENE: INT. NUMB3RS OFFICE. GLASS PARTITION WALL COVERED WITH VARIOUS POSITIVE WHOLE NUMBERS AND PHOTOGRAPHS OF VICTIMS NEXT TO THOSE NUMBERS. VARIOUS SCRIBBLINGS INDICATE FRUSTRATION. PRESENT ARE DON, FBI AGENT, CHARLIE, GENIUS MATHEMATICIAN, AND SENATOR GRAYSON, UNSYMPATHETIC SENATOR.)</p>
<p>CHARLIE: It doesn't make sense!  Thirty victims -</p>
<p>DON: -and one live Senator.</p>
<p>SEN. GRAYSON: I have to say I'm starting to get a little annoyed.  Your father told me you were the best -</p>
<p>CHARLIE: I <em>am</em> the best -</p>
<p>DON: He <em>is</em> the best -</p>
<p>[PAUSE. DON SNORTS.]</p>
<p>DON: I thought we'd agreed we both say 'he' in that situation.</p>
<p>CHARLIE: You're right, my bad.</p>
<p>SEN. GRAYSON: Look!  30 dead Americans, each with a number between 1 and 31 left on  their body, and me with the last number, Number 22.  Now, I've got a press conference waiting outside  where I'm going to announce my bid to run for President, and I need to reassure them I'm not next.  [TO CHARLIE] You're the mathematician.  What's the pattern, boy genius?</p>
<p>CHARLIE: I don't know.</p>
<p>SEN. GRAYSON: Pointless waste of time.</p>
<p>CHARLIE (SHOUTING): It doesn't make sense!  An accountant that was cooking her charity's  books gets an 8, a general facing war crime charges gets a 4, but a child-killer gets an 18, two con-artists that rip off the elderly get a 10 and an 11 each.  How am I supposed to know  what you getting a 22 in the mail means?</p>
<p>SEN. GRAYSON: Don't you care?  Figure it out.</p>
<p>CHARLIE: Of course I care.  Thirty murders -</p>
<p>DON: Twenty-nine.</p>
<p>SEN. GRAYSON: You told me there were thirty.</p>
<p>CHARLIE: Thirty deaths, twenty-nine murders.  Number 30 -</p>
<p>DON: - Jennifer Anderson -</p>
<p>CHARLIE: -wasn't murdered.  The serial killer broke into the morgue and planted the card on  her body afterwards.</p>
<p>DON: It was just her time.  [HE STANDS] Come on, Senator, we'll escort you to your press conference.</p>
<p>CHARLIE: ...What did you just say?</p>
<p>DON: I said, let's escort Senator Grayson -</p>
<p>CHARLIE: Nonono, before that.  What did you say?</p>
<p>DON: It was just Jennifer Anderson's time.</p>
<p>CHARLIE: It was just... her time.  That's it!  Senator, we have to get to your press conference immediately.</p>
<p>DON: What's going on, Charlie?</p>
<p>CHARLIE: Think, Don - what was the common link between all of these people?</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>(SCENE: PRESS CONFERENCE.  DON, CHARLIE AND SEN. GRAYSON ARE SAT ANSWERING  QUESTIONS.)</p>
<p>REPORTER: Senator, can you comment on these rumours that you are being targeted by a  mysterious serial killer and that the police have no leads?</p>
<p>SENATOR GRAYSON: They don't even know why I'm being targeted.</p>
<p>CHARLIE: That's... not quite true.  You see, Senator, there <em>is</em> a link between all of the victims  so far.  Think. Number 31 was a blackmailer who had bitten off more than he could chew.  Number 1 made threatening phonecalls for money. Number 6 went around killing doctors that worked in family planning, and Number 3 was a doctor that gave forced euthanizations.</p>
<p>DON: Charlie, we know all this.</p>
<p>CHARLIE: That's the point!  We know it now, but before this case began we didn't know about any of these people.  Every step the killer has been pointing out criminals to us that we didn't even know about, people that in some cases the FBI has been hunting for years.</p>
<p>SEN. GRAYSON: Are you accusing me of -</p>
<p>CHARLIE: Yes I am, Senator.  You've been targeted by a serial killer that only targets people that have proven to be expert criminals - and a killer that has never yet been wrong.  That's suspicion enough to warrant an investigation, <em>especially</em> given that you are number 22.</p>
<p>DON: Number 22? Charlie, what does it mean?  What are these numbers, Charlie?</p>
<p>CHARLIE: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_signal#POSIX_signals">Unix Signals</a>, Don.  Signals that come down from on high to stop computer programs from misbehaving.  It's a judgement from the Master Control Program that has found you wanting.  And you, Senator Grayson, have been found wanting.</p>
<p>REPORTER: And what does Number 22 mean, Dr. Eppes?</p>
<p>CHARLIE: Number 22: pollable event.  Electoral fraud.</p>
<p>[PANDEMONIUM.  SENATOR GRAYSON STANDS AND TRIES TO LEAVE AS CAMERAS FLASH.  CHARLIE AND DON HEAD FOR THE DOOR.]</p>
<p>DON: Charlie, wait -</p>
<p>[A MESSENGER HANDS CHARLIE A SQUARE PIECE OF CARD SIMILAR TO THOSE FOUND ON THE OTHER BODIES]</p>
<p>CHARLIE: Oh no...</p>
<p>[CHARLIE RUNS FOR THE DOOR. DON PICKS UP THE PAPER.  IT SAYS '23/21', THE NAME OF GRAYSON'S HEAD OF TECHNICAL STAFF (AMY), AND A HOME ADDRESS.  IT IS COVERED IN BLOOD.]</p>
<p>DON (SHOUTING): 23?  Charlie, what does 23 mean?</p>
<p>CHARLIE (SHOUTING): 'Stop executing'.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>(SCENE: INT. OF A SPARSELY FURNISHED FLAT.  CHARLIE IS STOOD, STARING AT THE DEAD BODY OF AMY. SHE HAS COMMITTED SUICIDE.  DON ENTERS, AND STANDS AT A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE.)</p>
<p>CHARLIE: She was a genius.  She did all these - exposed all those people -</p>
<p>DON: Exposed?  She killed them, Charlie.</p>
<p>CHARLIE: She must have had a reason, a reason to go along with it, a reason this was the only way she could get through to us.  Blackmail, extortion, or something.</p>
<p>DON: Charlie, there are two numbers here.  23, 'stop executing', and 21.  What does 21 mean?</p>
<p>CHARLIE: I guess she wanted to tell us where she had hidden the evidence that would bring down Grayson.  It might not be enough, Don - if she'd had enough she would have just come and talked to us - but it'll be a lot, and it'll be a start.</p>
<p>DON (SOOTHINGLY): Okay.  So where is the evidence?</p>
<p>(CHARLIE WALKS OVER TO THE WALL.)</p>
<p>CHARLIE: Signal 21.</p>
<p>(HE RIPS OUT A POWER SOCKET, REVEALING A CYLINDER FILLED WITH USB DRIVES AND NOTES.)</p>
<p>CHARLIE: High-bandwidth data is available at a socket.</p>
<p>(DON NODS SLOWLY, SCENE FADES TO BLACK.)</p>
