<p><em>Set in the Catch-22/Closing Time universe of Joseph Heller.</em></p>
<p>"You! Stop!"</p>
<p>It was autumn 1969, the evening air was balmy and pleasant, and Adam Peckem, formerly of the United States Air Force, was pointing a revolver at the sneak thief currently holding his television.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't shoot, if I were you," said the thief quickly. "Or you'll be shot for treason."</p>
<p>"Treason? What?" Cried Peckem. "Who are you? What are you doing?" A nasty suspicion formed in the back of his mind. "Are you T.S. Eliot?"</p>
<p>"I work for the Government." said the thief, "From the Federal Reserve. We are expropriating your television."</p>
<p>Ex-General Peckem tightened his grip on his revolver. "It looks to me like you're stealing."</p>
<p>"Of course I'm not stealing. Governments don't steal; they expropriate."</p>
<p>Peckem waved his firearm. "Show me some ID or get out of my house!"</p>
<p>The thief sneered. "You don't care much for your country, do you, General?" He tsk'ed. "Asking a secret Government agent to show ID."</p>
<p>"How did you know I was a General?" asked the General, anxiously fiddling with the stars on his white pyjamas. "Did Deedle send you?"</p>
<p>"I am here for the good of the American economy."</p>
<p>"You're stealing-"</p>
<p>"-expropriating-"</p>
<p>"stealing my television!"</p>
<p>"Of course I am," said the man. "If I didn't steal your television, you wouldn't buy another one. Look," he said, continuing. "Don't you want America to get out of this recession? Don't you want to live like a rich man?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do," snapped Peckem. "That's why I saved up for a television."</p>
<p>"Ah!" said the man, his eyes lighting up. "But if every rich man in America saved their money, they would all end up poor. That's the paradox of thrift: If one does not waste money, one becomes poor."</p>
<p>Sensing he had an attentive audience, and that Peckem was not likely to use the revolver he still clutched in his pale hands, the thief sidled closer and began to explain.</p>
<p>"In a recession, the Government has to get money moving around again. It could tax the rich, but politicians tend to be quite rich so that doesn't work. It can print money, but that just leads to inflation further down the line. So we steal rich people's televisions and sell them to poor people."</p>
<p>"Like a secret tax?"</p>
<p>"Not like a tax at all! Taxes create no wealth - they simply move money from people who probably didn't deserve it to people that definitely don't. If I steal a television from you and sell it to a poor person at a cheap price, you'll buy another television, supporting America's economy, the poor person will get a television, making them happier and more productive, and professional thieves shall be kept from lives of crime by working for the Government. When the economy improves, we discontinue the program and crime immediately goes down, and the people are even happier."</p>
<p>Peckem frowned. "I didn't vote for anything like this."</p>
<p>"So? The beauty of democracy is that the people can only vote against the things they know about."</p>
<p>A silence followed. Peckem stared blankly at the dark screen of the Government's television that sat in his living room. Soon, he frowned.</p>
<p>"Don't the politicians get angry when you steal their televisions?"</p>
<p>"Politicians don't have televisions. If they could see themselves speak, they wouldn't be such terrible people."</p>
<p>Peckem let out a terrible groan. "I'm a terrible person."</p>
<p>The thief began to busy himself with the numerous wires extruding from the Government's new television set. "Oh?"</p>
<p>"Nobody likes me. Socially, I mean."</p>
<p>"I'm not surprised," said the thief. "I've been in your house for almost twenty minutes and you've not even offered me a beer."</p>
<p>"I wanted to be somebody that people want to meet, but as soon as they got to know me they didn't want to meet me any more," mused Adam Peckem. "Do you know, not one person has ever said that they wanted to meet me after they've met me?"</p>
<p>The wires unplugged, the thief looked up again. "I work for the Government-"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, the Federal Reserve, you just said," snapped General Peckem. "I'm old, not daft."</p>
<p>"No," said the thief, "I mean, I work for the Government socially."</p>
<p>"You rob people socially?"</p>
<p>"This is my secret Government job. For me to be on the payroll, I have to have a non-secret job too. I go to parties."</p>
<p>"Do you," asked Ex-General Peckem, his lower lip trembling ever so slightly, "meet a lot of people at these parties?"</p>
<p>"Meeting people is my job."</p>
<p>"Ah," sighed Peckem, wistfully.</p>
<p>"I go to parties," repeated the thief, "and lie to make the people there feel like there's someone worse than them in the world. It makes them feel better about themselves."</p>
<p>"The Government gives you money to pretend to be poor?"</p>
<p>"Not worse off than them - worse than them. A worse human being. I tell them my job is to steal televisions from elderly ex-servicemen."</p>
<p>"I thought your job was secret."</p>
<p>"It is," said the thief, "but if my non-secret job is to lie about my non-secret job, I can tell them my secret job is my non-secret job. Look, if I told these people that my job was to lie to them then they'd realise what terrible people they were and stop enjoying the parties. That's why I have to lie and tell them that my job is stealing televisions." The thief turned to go, expropriated television in his arms.</p>
<p>Adam Peckem carefully put down his revolver. "I don't understand the world any more."</p>
<p>The thief paused in the doorway. "You should really try to keep up with current events. Watch the news. Get yourself a television."</p>
