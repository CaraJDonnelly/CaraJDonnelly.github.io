<p><em>(After "<a href="http://galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html">The Egg</a>" by Andy Weir.)</em></p>
<p>You were on your way home when you died.</p>
<p>It was a helicopter accident - and quite an unusual one. Fatal, of course. You left behind a well respected legal firm and countless soon-to-be-heartbroken friends.</p>
<p>And that’s when you met me. Again.</p>
<p>“What… what happened?” You asked. “Where am I?”</p>
<p>“You died,” I said, nicely.</p>
<p>“There was a… helicopter and it…”</p>
<p>“Yes, dear.” I said.</p>
<p>“I… I died?”</p>
<p>“It's normal, dear. Don't worry about it,” I said.</p>
<p>You looked around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. “What is this place?” You asked. “Is this the afterlife?”</p>
<p>“More or less,” I said.</p>
<p>“Are you god?” You asked.</p>
<p>I winced. “No, dear.”</p>
<p>“My kids… my wife,” you said, ignoring me.</p>
<p>I shifted from foot to foot.  21st century language's obsession with possessive pronouns always made me fidget.  You continued.</p>
<p>“Will they be all right?”</p>
<p>“They'll be fine.” I paused. “Anything else?”</p>
<p>You looked at me with fascination, ignoring my question. To you, I didn’t look like God. I just looked like a parent that hadn't got enough sleep for a few years. You decided I must be God and therefore male, and I sighed again.</p>
<p>“What about Alice?” I asked.</p>
<p>“My dog?” You asked. I nodded, and you shrugged. “Well, Cathy will take care of her. So what happens now? Wait, I'm remembering... this is like that story with the egg. The universe egg!”</p>
<p>I waited, silently. You have to take your silence where you can.</p>
<p>“The universe is an egg, and I am every person in it - am I right? I'm learning to be compassionate by living every human life one after another - yeah? Every human misery is just something I've inflicted on myself - so I can be like a god one day?”</p>
<p>“Almost, dear,” and despite myself at that point tiredness took over and a small edge entered my voice. “Remember I told you before, not every human life, but the life of every social animal.”</p>
<p>“What?” You said, blankly.</p>
<p>“You're learning what cruelty and love are, dear, so you live through all animals that feel those things - all animals that can form emotional relationships. Humans, elephants, dolphins, dogs, even cats.” I said. “Not hamsters. Let's go for a walk.”</p>
<p>You followed along as we strode through the void. “Why are we walking?”</p>
<p>“It's good for you.” I said, shortly. “Alice is going to be upset that you died. You adopted her from her mother when she was a puppy - she thinks of you as her parent.”</p>
<p>“So what's the point?” You asked, ignoring me once more. “Wasting a lot of time learning how wolves live together. What's the use in that?”</p>
<p>I stopped walking and hugged you to give myself a moment to find loving words. “You'll understand that when you're older, dear. Now I think it's time for you to go.”</p>
<p>You looked frightened, and I hugged you again, as hard and as long as I could.</p>
<p>“Who will I be, next time?”</p>
<p>“I never tell you,” I lied, “It's best for you to find out for yourself. I love you, dear. I want you to remember that.”</p>
<p>And I sent you back to the abattoir.</p>
