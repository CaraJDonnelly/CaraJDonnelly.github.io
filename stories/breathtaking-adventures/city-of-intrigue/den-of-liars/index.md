Jack Pike's hideout was a piece of May's childhood.

He had escorted her at gunpoint through the deserted back streets of South London to a row of townhouses.  Jack Pike had opened the servant's gate to a house with a flourish.  May, still acting as Princess Amanda, had turned up her nose.  She had only passed through when Pike had begun waving his gun again.  Inside, the filthy kitchen brought memories flooding back.

Her father had worked at a hundred such houses.  May had been a maid as soon as she had been old enough to carry laundry.  The kitchen had that peculiar mix of smells: salt water for the stonework, and lye soap for the countertops.  May clenched her gloved hands by her sides.  Calluses from laundry-baskets and rawnail from lye never quite fade.  She squeezed her eyes shut then opened them wide.  *I will never be that person again*, she vowed.

Jack Pike was stood waiting on the other side of the long countertop next to a stool.  *Of course*, she thought.  *I'm royalty*.  She seated herself and he followed suit.  Jack Pike calmly picked up a knife from the countertop.  He proceeded to slice a mouldy, maggoty glazed ham onto a plate.  Then he sliced some bread and passed her both, along with some rancid butter.  His scarred face was a blank mask.

Why was he being nice?  Something was wrong.  The roof swooped down at her in her sudden panic.  Had she just given herself away?  There were too many questions.  Such a large house should have at least six servants plus Lords and Ladies upstairs.  Where were the servants?  Why had the streets been so empty?

She collected her thoughts.  What did she want?  She picked a maggot out of her rancid ham sandwich.  First, she wanted to eat. She bit into the sandwich.  The texture, look and smell were disgusting.  Worst of all it tasted fine.  She gagged.  Food should never lie.

Second, she wanted to get away from her abductor.  Jack Pike was faster and stronger than her, so running and fighting were out.  That left mendacity.  Happily Mendacity was May Merryweather's middle name.

*Or was it?*

She focused.  The key to any good Lie is to understand what your companion wants to hear.  She looked at Jack Pike.  *Jack Pike is a scarred ruffian with a smooth chin about whom I knew nothing*, she thought.

"Might I ask where you were born?" she asked.  *Courtesy never goes amiss*, her father whispered.  "Master Pike?" she added.  Jack Pike twitched.

"Langdale, in Cumbria.  I worked as a weaver."  Jack Pike's spine just barely straightened.  *Jack Pike is a scarred ruffian proud of either his birthplace or his profession*.  May pressed on.

"I've always admired hessian for autumn dresses," she continued.  "But I've always wished for a lighter fabric for summer."

That should be an easy hook for a weaver.  Obvious answers were chiffon or chambray, and he would feel valuable.  Choosing chiffon would show that Jack Pike was more metropolitan.  Choosing chambray would show him to be more traditional.  Either case would give her more options to pursue.  He didn't immediately reply, so May pushed with more flattery.  "Hard enough to get fine thread these days," May ventured.  Jack Pike said nothing.

She pressed again.  "Surely a man as refined as you might suggest a fresh choice?"

Jack Pike's shoulders tensed and his pupils dilated.  May blinked.  Her flattery had hit a nerve.  An upset abductor with a knife was not what she wanted.  She fluttered her lashes to cover up the blink and pivoted onto safer ground.

"At any rate, we may be grateful that -- despite it being autumn -- the climate is so dry today."  His shoulders relaxed.

"Aye," he said.  He bit into his own rancid sandwich.  *Jack Pike is not a scarred meteorologist*. It is always best to notice everything one has ruled out about a person.  His pupils were still dilated.  One more aimless sentences about the weather, then she could probe again.  Carefully.

"It's been so dry it's felt almost like Spring," she said.  She looked down demurely and let her mind race.  *Jack Pike is a scarred ruffian who (by elimination) is proud of his birthplace and becomes distressed when called refined*.  What else did she know?  He was new to London, since the papers hadn't mentioned a scarred ruffian.  There was no clear line of inquiry.  She bit into her sandwich and chewed.

A maggot popped in her mouth.  Maggot-juice sprayed over her tongue and throat.  She squeaked, then choked on her mouthful of rancid food.  She swallowed the mouthful so she could breathe.  She   realised what she had just swallowed.  She retched.  Tears flooded her eyes.  She wished for cabbage soup.

Jack Pike gracefully ignored the disgusting sounds she was making.  "Yes," he said loudly over her snorting grunts.  "Aye.  Nice weather for walks."

Her eyes opened wide.  *Jack Pike is a scarred ruffian who acts like a gentleman to a choking woman, is proud of his birthplace, and who tenses at the mention of nobility*.  Was one of his loved ones mistreated by the local lord, perhaps?

"Do your family go walking together, Master Pike?"

He snorted.  "My family are a waste of space."

Enlightenment flooded in.  May Merryweather understood her prey.  *Jack Pike is a young gentlemen disguised as a scarred old ruffian*.  Her eyes flicked up to study his face.  A disguise is as thick as its thinnest part. A smooth cheek covered with an artful fake scar.  A brow accentuated with putty and decorated with thick grey eyebrows.  She had seen his face before.  She had seen his face hanging in the National Gallery.  *Oh no*.

Jack Pike -- more commonly known to the public as Jonathan Leopold, Crown Prince of Great Britain, Ireland And The Nice Bit Of France -- stared into her eyes.  His voice was low and soft.  "What about your family, *Princess Amanda*?"
