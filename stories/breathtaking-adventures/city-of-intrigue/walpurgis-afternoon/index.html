<p>May loved the clocks for being wrong.</p>
<p>Every Sunday night someone came around to reset the Small Clocks to match the Big Clock.  At thirty minutes past six, post-meridian, they walked from the Big Clock to the first Small Clock.  They climbed it, set it to thirty minutes past six, wound it, then climbed back down.  Then they walked to the next Small Clock, and so on.</p>
<p>The Department for Museums and War sat in a single circular room.  The room had curved windows to let in the summer sunlight and was large enough to hold one thousand people.  Direct sunlight was bad for the <i>archeological rarities</i> the department processed, so a tent stood in one corner of the circular room.  Public spaces were bad for the <i>military strategies</i> the department devised, so a meeting-room was set up opposite the tent.  The availability of large tents and meeting-rooms being what they are these took the form of a circus tent and a potting shed.</p>
<p>Between the circus tent and the potting shed stood the Big Clock, a masterpiece of expensive engineering.  It wound itself from the atmosphere, set itself by the sunlight, and cleaned itself in the drafts.  Its mechanical redundancies meant it rarely needed repair.</p>
<p>The downside of its complexity was its proportions.  The Big Clock was as wide as a gorilla and as tall as a giraffe, but the Big Clock’s face was the size of an ordinary housecat.  Imagine placing an ordinary housecat atop a giraffe.  It is a wholly unsuitable arrangement for the practical matter of telling the time.</p>
<p>In response the Department of Museums and War erected twenty large Small Clocks, each larger and cheaper than the last.  They encircled the Department and each showed their own particular time.</p>
<p>May Merryweather’s desk sat exactly in line with the main entrance to the Department.  If she looked leftwards, she saw the first, smallest, dearest Small Clock.  This clock was the first to be set in time with the Big Clock.  It showed <i>almost</i> the correct time for most of the week.</p>
<p>If she looked rightwards, she saw the last, largest, cheapest Small Clock.  This clock was always the last to be set in time with the Big Clock, a full thirty minutes after the first Small Clock.  It was immediately hopelessly behind and got worse as the week went on.</p>
<p>“Are you Merryweather?” barked a stout man with a straight back and a red face.  May drew her gaze up from her paperwork.  She nodded.</p>
<p>“We had an appointment,” he growled, “at ten this morning.  We were --”</p>
<p>The man broke off speaking.  May had removed her glasses and started deliberately squinting rightwards.  The stout man turned to see what she was squinting at.</p>
<p>The last, largest, cheapest Small Clock stood at twelve minutes past ten, ante-meridian.  The stout man’s jaw dropped.  May Merryweather rose.</p>
<p>“Sergeant Buck, I do <i>so</i> apologise for keeping you waiting.”  She glided around the right-hand side of her desk and took the stunned man’s hand for a second.  Over his shoulder she saw the first, smallest, dearest Small Clock stood at twenty-four minutes past twelve, post-meridian.  She suppressed a wince.  “I've completely lost track of time.”  She shot the stout man a pleading look.</p>
<p>Eventually she mollified the confused Sergeant Buck.  They discussed Department business until she could get rid of him.  She relaxed, and glared leftwards at the first, smallest, dearest Small Clock.  It now stood at two hours, post-meridian.  The canteen was shut and she had missed lunch.</p>
<p>Her stomach growled.  Growling stomachs were neither ladylike nor professional.  May Merryweather prided herself on appearing to be both of these things.  She stood and sailed out the main entrance in search of a late lunch.  Her stomach growled at her assistant Percy as she passed.  <i>If an assistant can’t keep my appointments away from me, what is he for?</i> she thought.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>The bus Number Minus Eighty-Eight that would take her North to Hope’s Pies was cancelled.  A poster gave the reason as a street parade in honour of lunchtimes.  She glared at the bus stop sign, cursed under her breath and started her mental arithmetic.</p>
<p>As in all modern bus systems, London’s buses obeyed the laws of algebra.  Negative-numbered buses took you North or West and positive-numbered buses took you South or East.  This meant taking the Number Fourteen then the Number <i>Minus</i> Fourteen got you back to where you started.  Moreover, if you missed the Number Fourteen then it was almost as convenient to take the Nine, the Twelve, and then the Minus Seven.  It was an excellent system.</p>
<p>May boarded the Minus Ninety-One, intending to take the Number Three a single stop to Hope’s Pies.  The Number Three, being an odd prime, only ran on even-numbered weekdays.  Thwarted, she cursed again and hopped on the Forty-Seven.  She then made a dash to change onto a Number Two Express.</p>
<p>It was at this point that May Merryweather's life started to be rather stressful.</p>
<p>The Number Two Express is, of course, usually written as the Number 2x.  This means it whisks you to where you already are, but twice as far.  May had so far effectively taken the Minus Forty-Four.  Taking the Number 2x was entirely in line with her original desire to take the Minus Eighty-Eight.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate, then, that since she was trying to head North she boarded a bus with a minus sign in its number.  The Number <i>-2x</i> whisks you to twice as far as where you <i>aren't</i>.  The steam boiler on the Number -2x bus let out a screaming whistle and began tearing across London in exactly the wrong direction.</p>
<p>At this point May Merryweather considered bursting into tears.  It was ladylike and since she was not at the Department she did not need to be professional.  She scowled instead, and jumped off the Number -2x between stops.  She had no idea where she was and by this point didn’t much care provided she got some lunch soon.  She determinedly floated into the nearest public house --</p>
<p>-- straight into a masked man brandishing an antique pistol.</p>
<p>“Drat,” said May, as her stomach growled sadly.</p>
