<p>The <i>second</i> thing anyone noticed about the public house's bar was its unreasonable narrowness and unreasonable length.  It curved around, never more than four feet wide, until it curved out of sight.  On its floor it had sturdy wooden stools and a long, curving Persian rug which was stained with beer and tobacco.</p> 

<p>The <i>first</i> thing anyone noticed was the gunman.  He had skin like bark, a deep scar in his left cheek, and a workman's hat he had not removed despite being a man indoors in the presence of ladies.  He was grinning at her with greed in his left eye.  His right eye was made of bright red glass with a black round iris.  He was plainly a rough customer.</p>

<p>May Merryweather know a good thing when she saw it, and this was not it.  There are remarkably <i>few</i> times it is unwise to pretend to be a member of the Royal Family.  When bathing alone it is always fine.  When attempting to gain entry to a restaurant without a reservation it is often advantageous.  When meeting a member of the Royal Family it is usually -- but not always -- unwise.  Whilst accidentally interrupting a robbery it is downright foolish.</p>

<p>She considered running away down the length of the bar.  Perhaps there were people sitting just out of sight.  Perhaps they hadn't noticed the bar was being robbed.  Perhaps they were eating lunch.  Perhaps they would ask her to join them, and they would eat pie.  Perhaps there would be gravy.  May sighed, wistfully.  She couldn't outrun a bullet.  Besides, the way the day had gone so far, the other end of the bar was probably being robbed by <i>two</i> gunmen.</p>

<p>"Did you say," the gunman said, "Amanda, Princess of Scotland?"</p>

<p>May hesitated.  She thought of her father's dying words: "Never be caught in a lie."  She had wept as he expired in her arms on the casino floor.  A poisoned roulette ball had taken him from her.  She had howled her pain at the sky and swore never to forget.</p>

<p>Later that week she had found that her father had only been pretending to die.  He had wanted to attend the Contessa de Bretagne's Winter Ball and needed to sneak in through the chapel where dead bodies were lain in state before being buried.  The Contessa's men had caught him and publicly flogged him in the square.  The shame had been terrible, and so the truth of it stood: May Merryweather made sure that no matter how much she lied, she never, ever got caught out.  Ever.</p>

<p>"Naturally," she said.  She felt her face blush red at her words.  "I am Amanda, Princess of Scotland."</p>

<p>"Looks like this robbery just got more interesting," the gunman said to the bar.  The bar's patrons nodded.  "I was about to demand you all hand over your purses," he said.  "But now I've got bigger fish to fry."  The bar's patrons applauded politely.  They raised their tankards to May and mouthed their thanks.</p>

<p>May Merryweather swallowed.  It was rent week and she really could not afford to be robbed.  She spoke before she had time to think.  "We suppose you propose to take us hostage?"  The gunman hesitated.  His eyes flicked down to her shoulder bag.  She went wild with inspiration.  "And demand as ransom the Scottish Diamond Crown?"</p>

<p>His eye lit up and she sighed with relief.  Her rent money was safe.  Now she just had to deal with being a fake princess hostage with a gunman to whom she had just promised a fictional crown.  <i>Oh.  Oh goodness.</i>  She swallowed again.  She was still sweating from having run around London.  The long narrow bar room swayed and contracted around her like a distraught accordion.</p>

<p>When she regained her senses someone had helped her to a seat and placed a glass of small beer in front of her.  She sipped it delicately.  She must make the best of a bad situation.  She took a deep breath.</p>

<p>"Your name," she ordered of the gunman in her best Princess voice.</p>

<p>"Jack Pike," he said.  While she was fainting he had sat opposite her.  Now the two of them were sat nearest the door so he could point his gun at anyone who moved.  With a jolt she saw he was much younger than had first appeared.  The bark-thick skin, scarred face and demonic red eye concealed a man barely older than herself.  And he <i>still</i> had not removed his hat.</p>

<p>"You will, we suppose, require us to eat all manner of thick pastries?  We understand it to be traditional for hostages."  She shifted a little.  "So they're full of food?"  Jack Pike frowned.  "So they can't run away."</p>

<p>Jack Pike's expression cleared.  He gestured with his gun to the barmaid.  "Meat pies."  May's heart thrilled.</p>

<p>"We haven't any pies, sir," the barmaid stammered.  "Just cabbage soup."</p>

<p>Pike shrugged.  "One bowl of cabbage soup."</p>

<p>"But that's not filling at <i>all</i>," May cried.  She bit her tongue, but it was too late.  Jack Pike nodded.</p>

<p>"Ten bowls of cabbage soup," he said.  "With extra cabbage."</p>

<p>Soon a steaming barrel of cabbage soup and a silver spoon were set out on the low table.  It smelled of gymnastics class and looked like a laundry barrel filled with wet green socks.</p>

<p>"We recall we just ate --" she began.  Jack Pike grinned wolfishly.  He shook his head and jabbed his gun at the soup.  "Eat, Your Highness.  I don't want you running away.  I want that Scottish Diamond Crown."</p>

<p>May shut her eyes.  A tear ran down her cheek.  Her absence would surely be noted at work.  She was a hostage to a gunman who expected a diamond crown that didn't exist.  Worst of all, she was dreadfully hungry for meat pie and was about to eat cabbage soup.</p>

<p>She picked up her silver spoon, dipped it into the steaming barrel, and began to chew.  <i>Can my day get any worse?</i></p>
