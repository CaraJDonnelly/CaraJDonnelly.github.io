<p>It was the day Atlantis fell.</p>
<p>The sun was shining through the miles of ocean water.  Children were laughing as they blew bubbles from diamond soap.  Twenty-five thousand miles away the first comptronium bombs were detonating.</p>
<p>The first they knew of it at Hari-varṣa Guhaa was when the Silfurberg channels went dark.  It took just under one sixth of a second for the red light, the colour used to transmit urgent information, to go out.  It took less than a hundredth of a second for the yellow, blue and violet channels to go dark too.</p>
<p>If someone had acted right then, they could have saved someone.  Anyone.  A Controller.  A commuter.  A child blowing bubbles from diamond soap.  They could have saved someone if they'd been paying attention.</p>
<p>They didn't.</p>
<p>Everyone died.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>The tunnel lit up with a blinding light, and the round door slammed shut behind them.</p>
<p>"There was a scream, Professor," said Diggy from her shoulder.</p>
<p>Professor Boyle nodded.  "Someone needs our help!  Let's go," she replied, and started to run towards the sound.  Diggy groaned as her pace bumped his broken leg, and she stopped.</p>
<p>"You stay here," she said.  "Here.  Destroy the door."</p>
<p>She handed him her thermite pouch from her belt.  It was soaked through, but the wax-wrapped matches were dry and usable.  Diggy nodded.</p>
<p>The scream came again, louder, and the walls pulsed in synchrony.  Professor Roberta Boyle started to run in earnest towards the sound.  As she ran, she worked her Bowie knife free from its sheath under her left arm, and started breathing deeply.  In through her nose, out through her mouth.  In through her nose, out through her mouth.  As she breathed, she remembered her smithing coach Hyfaidd's untimely death in the Spanish smithing purges.  Without slowing, she crossed herself in his memory.</p>

<p><i>INTRUDERS!  INVADERS! </i></p>
<p>Clay teeth chittered in the darkness.</p>
<p><i>MURDERERS!</i></p>

<p>The Professor had reached a junction and skidded to a halt, breathing heavily.  The soles of her boots were edged with sealskin, sewn from her childhood friend Flippy, and still the tunnel floor was slippery beneath her feet.  It smelled like stale seawater.  The light had stabilised to a harsh and cold blue that emanated from all walls equally.  There were no shadows here.  Professor Boyle looked at the barometer set into the handle of her Bowie knife.  The air pressure was maxed out.  They were at least four miles underwater, and the tunnels ahead were sloping steadily down.</p>
<p>The tunnels were not perfectly circular.  The floor was flat for a width of around four large paces.  The walls curved up to form a smooth arch as a roof.  The junction had two stained and broken signs set before each split.  Rust had made short work of them over the years, and they were now indecipherable.  The one on the right had a barely-legible header that read "Utsava Ketuu".</p>
<p>The scream could have come from either direction.  Professor Boyle stepped into the mouth of the right-hand fork of the junction.  Her Bowie knife sat easily in her augmented hand.</p>
<p>The junction opened out onto a broader tunnel set at right angles to the junction.  The walls were more square rather than smoothly rounded, and glowed the now-familiar electric blue.  The roof was higher, was made of dark glass.  Outside the glass the ocean was murky.  A family of Humboldt squid were pressed up against the glass.  One of them waved.</p>
<p>She waved back; one should always be polite to cephalopods, even squid.</p>
<p>"Heat," she muttered.  "This place is warm."</p>
<p>The floor of the broader tunnel was half as wide as its roof.  Four paces into the room it dropped off sharply into a long dark trench that ran the long room's length.  Immediately to her right was an iron barrier, as rusted and decayed as the signage.  Upon the ironwork hung several dirty tiles of various sharp shapes and bright colours.  Professor Boyle had seen enough ancient temples to know warning signs when she saw them.</p>
<p>Opposite her, above the dark trench, there were bright crystal square frames.  Unlike the rest of the walls, the interior of these frames were not glowing blue.  She cupped her unaugmented hand around her left eye and squinted through it.  With the bright light from the walls blocked out she could see one frame contained ornate lettering, so covered with grime that she had to strain to make it out.  The background to the lettering was curved and somewhat brown -- perhaps an amphora.  The next frame was so smudged and filthy all writing is hidden, and all remains is an exquisite painting of the grey face of a screaming human child.</p>
<p>The next scream came from directly behind her.  When the sound had been filtered through miles of twisting tunnels it had been robbed of its emotion.  Up close, there was no mistaking it: rage, pain and hatred.</p>
<p>Professor Roberta Boyle set off down the platform at a dead run.</p>
