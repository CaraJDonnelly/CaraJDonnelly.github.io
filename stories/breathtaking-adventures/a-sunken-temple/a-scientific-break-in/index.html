<p>Roberta Boyle, the smartest person ever to have reinvented the hammer, had no intention of dying on this cursed oil rig.</p>
<p>"Diggy," she shouted.  "Abraham is dead.  Sea took him."</p>
<p>There was no response, but she knew Diggy had heard.  She looked down at the sea from her position on the viewing platform.  It was roaring like a hurt tiger and looked intent on smashing the rig to smithereens.</p>
<p>"Diggy," she shouted again.  "Prepare the distributed distress beacon!"</p>
<p>The distributed distress beacon was one of Professor Boyle's inventions.  It was composed of five distress beacons of different types, all attached to flotation devices.  These flotation devices were in turn connected to a central life raft.  The central life raft could accommodate either six people, or two people and one frightened horse.  She had never had an occasion to test it before today, and cursed her luck.</p>
<p>"Why did this damn storm have to kill my horse?"  She shook her augmented right fist at the sky.  "Diggy!  Where are you?"  She turned away from the sea to shout for her manservant better.  "Diggy!"</p>
<p>"Here, Professor," came a low, mushy voice from directly behind her.  Professor Roberta Boyle still had no idea how he did that.  Instead, as a scientist AND engineer, she had begun to take advantage of her manservant's abilities.  Every time she needed him to arrive immediately she would stand at the end of a dead end or one pace in front of a wall.  That way, when he suddenly appeared, he sure to be close at hand, and thus of most use to her.  She still jumped.</p>
<p>"Activate the distributed distress beacon!" she shouted.  She was shouting just in case he had been temporarily deafened by the rushing of the storm.  There was no time to take chances.</p>
<p>"Professor, the sea tore it away from the launching platform."  Diggy lisped.  "It's gone, Professor."</p>
<p>Professor Roberta Boyle frowned.  "I need to discover or invent a solution to our predicament, quick.  Diggy, flip a coin!" she shouted.</p>
<p>"Heads, Professor."</p>
<p>"Diggy, flip a coin again, first deciding which sides correspond with discovery and invention!"</p>
<p>"Discovery, Professor."</p>
<p>"Damn!"  She strode forward, the titanium nails in her boots raising sparks on the iron gangway.  "Discovering anything on an oil rig is going to be difficult.  Maybe I could discover inner peace or how to die with perfect nobility?"</p>
<p>"That violates Rule Twenty-Six, Professor," groaned Diggy.</p>
<p>"Rule Twenty-Six: Discoveries Not Known By Anyone Living," she cursed again.  "Maybe we could decide that everyone else that claimed to have discover inner peace was lying?  Could we discover <i>lies</i> in previous discoveries?"</p>
<p>"Brilliant as ever, Professor," murmured Diggy.  "Truly our deaths will be an important contribution to human knowledge."</p>
<p>"Yes."  The Professor stood, considering.  "Screw that.  Let's discover what happens when you detonate enough explosives on one side of an oil rig to propel the other side clear of a deadly storm.  Nothing in the literature about <i>that</i>.  Meet me at the bottom of the oil rig."</p>
<p>She turned and ran as fast as she could towards the iron guardrail.  At the last moment she grabbed the iron guardrail with both hands.  This flipped her over the iron guardrail, and she curled and tucked into a spinning ball.  She calculated the optimal moment, reached out and grabbed the second-to-lowest deck with one hand as it whizzed past.  Her hand acted as a pivot and swung her at full speed out across the lowest deck on the oil rig.  Now, after pivoting, she was spinning <em>backwards</em> relative to the floor beneath her.  That wasn't good.  She used the same hand she'd used to pivot to do one more flip off of the surface of the deck.  This flipped her up onto her feet, again at a dead run.</p>
<p>She did all this with her left, unaugmented hand.  Otherwise it wouldn't be fun.</p>
<p>She reached the locked supply cupboard that was set into one of the six enormous concrete pillars that supported the oil rig.  They were now only metres above the roiling surface of the roaring sea.  Occasionally huge waves would rush up from underneath and slam into a pillar.  The slamming of huge waves left more visible cracks each time.  She stopped and carefully turned her back on the door to the supply cupboard.</p>
<p>"Diggy!  I am preparing to initiate explosive extraction," she bellowed. "By which I mean extraction of explosives, rather than an extraction described as explosive.  Where are you?"</p>
<p>She glanced behind her at the locked door.  She was irritated to find Diggy not between her and the locked supply cupboard door.  She turned around fully to make sure.</p>
<p>"Here, Professor." She jumped, and looked behind her again.  True to form Diggy had appeared behind her, albeit at a distance of about twenty metres.  He began shuffling towards her.  She frowned.  Had he appeared behind her because he had been unable to appear behind her, or had he appeared behind her because she had expected him to appear behind her?  Another intriguing datapoint in the ongoing mystery that was her manservant.</p>
<p>Another huge wave slammed into a pillar adjacent to the one they by which they were currently stood.  The gantry beneath their feet groaned and shook.  She executed a perfect spinning back kick and shattered the oak door into pieces.</p>
<p>"Come on, Diggy," she shouted, "let's get those expl -- <i>oh</i>..."</p>
<p>The supply cupboard held the usual quantity of explosives that any decent supply cupboard in any place, such as a military base or secondary school, might hold.  Behind the explosives there was not the rough concrete one would expect from any decent supply cupboard in any place such as a military base or secondary school, but smooth, blue marble.  Smooth, blue, <em>shimmering</em> marble.</p>
<p>"Diggy!" she shouted, striding forward.  "Add Electric Marble to the Discovery List!  We've also discovered the -- " here she paused to read the lettering carved into the lintel of a shimmering blue marble doorway. " -- the Temple of Hari-varṣa Guhaa!"</p>
