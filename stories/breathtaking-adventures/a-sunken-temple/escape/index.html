<p>Professor Roberta Boyle staggered down a long corridor with glowing blue walls.  Her right hand was squeezing a shard of grey mirrored glass.  Her augmented left hand was keeping pressure on a gut wound that was deep and bloody.</p>
<p>Her manservant, Diggy, didn’t bother gasping or asking questions.  Instead he silently passed over some socks he had torn into bandages.  Tearing his socks into bandages was an unconscious habit he had acquired whilst working for the Professor.  It exasperated his family immensely, especially at Christmas.</p>
<p>She accepted the makeshift bandages and politely refused a small glass of sherry.  Diggy’s habits had been leaking both ways.</p>
<p>Some minutes passed.</p>
<p>Professor Boyle finished bandaging her midriff and gestured that she was ready for the sherry.  She tossed it back in one gulp.  She stared at the shard of mirror she clutched in her right hand.  It was still digging into her flesh and squeezing blood from her unaugmented palm.  She slipped it into her lined pocket made specially for fragile artefacts.  She silently began stumbling up the stone spiral staircase that Diggy had blasted open with thermite.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>"Neutral buoyancy," she spat into the howling winds. “That’s our way home."</p>
<p>Professor Boyle looked behind her to see if Diggy had heard.  The rain lashed her eyes and she began counting the rhythm of the raindrops. Few people can blink so that the rain only ever hits the outside of their eyelids.  Professor Boyle was one of them.</p>
<p>"Neutral buoyancy," repeated Diggy from in front of her.  She flinched in surprise, then nodded.</p>
<p>They stood atop a ruined concrete pillar in the debris of what had once been a supply cupboard.  The storm had ripped away the entire oil rig platform.  The other five pillars were gone.</p>
<p>“This pillar didn't sink,” she said.  With her augmented hand she gripped a piece of concrete still attached to the pillar floor.  She wrenched it free and tossed it into the ocean.  It was borne away by the waves as quick as a dolphin.  It did not sink like a stone.  “The temple must be made of stone that can float.”</p>
<p>Diggy wiped the rain out of his eyes.  An awful grinding noise sounded and the pillar juddered underneath them.  A wave hit, and they both staggered.  Professor Boyle sighed.</p>
<p>"Diggy," she said, "ready the explosives."  She sat and braced her back against a broken wall.  Her gut wound hurt.  "Drop them into the staircase and separate us from the temple.”</p>
<p>The supply cupboard's explosives had mostly been washed into the ocean.  All that remained was four firkins of gunpowder and one fuse rope nine yards long.  The fuse rope was coiled in the approved nautical fashion and had been stowed in a waterproof locker.  Diggy lined up the barrels at the entrance to the spiral staircase.  He set the fuse rope to the fullest firkin and wound it round the barrel such that it would unroll when they pushed it down the stairs.  He nodded to Professor Boyle.  She nodded back.  He shoved the barrels and they began rolling down the spiral stairs.</p>
<p>She had used all the matches escaping from the flooding temple cavern.  With her augmented left hand she drew her Bowie knife.  She worked her fingernails under the inset barometer's glass cover and levered it free.  She heaved her arm up to the skyline.  Below them the firkins of gunpowder bounced down the spiral staircase.  Somewhere above her, behind thick roiling stormclouds, shone the Sun.</p>
<p>The cloud cover broke for an instant.  Sunlight flashed through the barometer cover to focus on the tip of the fuse rope, which burst into flame.  The fire roared down the fuse rope into the depths of the spiral staircase.</p>
<p>There was a satisfying explosion, and the Temple was no more.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>Several days passed.</p>
<p>-------</p>
<p>Roberta Boyle was on night watch.  She examined the stars.  They looked fundamentally correct.  According to her improvised sextant the ocean currents were taking them towards Scotland.  They would be at sea for perhaps another two days.  Diggy was asleep.</p>
<p>She flexed her right hand.  On the face of it nothing so unusual had happened.  All archaeological expeditions involved discovering and immediately destroying an ancient temple.  She checked that Diggy was still asleep, then spoke aloud the thing that had been bothering her.</p>
<p>"Vice-chancellor," she whispered to the ocean’s night.  It had an interesting sound.  "Vice-chancellor Roberta Boyle."</p>
<p>She closed her eyes and thought back to her battle with the monster in the temple.  She had known things then that she did not know now.  Moreover, she had understood things then she did not understand now.  Atlantis was only a legend, but that temple had been an Atlantean temple.  She remembered being certain of it, and had no idea why.</p>
<p>She reached a decision at dawn.  "We need to act," she started.  Then she trailed off, frowning.  She took a deep breath and began to recite.  "We need to act.  Discover or Invent, or..." and she trailed off again.  The memories would not come into focus.</p>
<p>"Diggy," she said, her eyes screwed tight.  Diggy groaned from his bed.  She continued anyway.  "What do you call it when you sit down with paper and pen, and you make up stories for how things are going to go wrong?  Then you make up more stories about how things are going to go right after all?"</p>
<p>"Making a plan, Professor?"</p>
<p>Professor Roberta Boyle beamed.  Making up stories was fun, so maybe making up plans could be fun too.</p>
<p>"Yes,” she started.  “We need to act.  Discover, Invent," she recited, "and Plan.  Yes.  Plan.  We’re going to Plan, Diggy."  She took a deep breath and bared her teeth into the wind.</p>
<p>"We're going to find Atlantis."</p>
