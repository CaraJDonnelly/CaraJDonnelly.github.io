<p>The supply cupboard was as dark as a tomb, and considerably less welcoming.</p>
<p>The pillar had been constructed of many concentric slabs of concrete set around twisted steel supports.  The door had been a weak point, and when the enormous wave had struck the outside the internal steel supports had snapped.  Professor Roberta Boyle knew the pillars had been designed to give the pillars a high toleration of tensile strain together with negligible internal stresses from thermal gradients.  In other words, the pillars could bend a little with strong waves and would not crack when the ocean was colder than the air above the surface.  This knowledge did nothing to help her shift the enormous slab of steel-reinforced concrete that was now blocking the entrance.  Behind her, somewhere on the ground, Diggy moaned in pain.</p>
<p>She took two steps forwards in the darkness and sniffed.  The air in the cupboard was warm, dry, and fresh.  The ocean air was cold, wet and fresh.  The other enclosed spaces on this oil rig had been warm, and stale.  Warm, dry, and fresh was suspicious.  It suggested that the marble doorway she had briefly seen before the wave struck led somewhere interesting.  On cue, another wave struck the outside of the pillar.</p>
<p>She reached out a hand to steady herself leaned against the blue marble.  It had gone dark when the enormous wave struck.  She closed her eyes, the better to concentrate, flattened herself against the now-inert blue marble doorway, and recalled the training given to her by Monsieur Bogomolov in the mountains of Tibet.</p>
<p><i>Respire como o vento. Veja como o morcego.</i> she intoned in her cavernous imagination.  <i>Breathe like the wind.  See like the bat.</i></p>
<p>She was rewarded with the discovery of a faint, low tremor in the blue marble stonework in the pillar.  It was as low and as consistent as the breathing of a large elephant.  For a brief instant Professor Boyle feared she had discovered nothing more exciting than another Ancient Whale Graveyard.  The tremor in the stonework faded away.  She remained standing still, counting her breaths.  One hundred and fifty breaths (or three minutes and seven seconds later) the low tremor returned.  It didn’t sound alive in any conventional sense.</p>
<p>As Nyquist once said: a good engineer gathers twice as much data as she thinks she'll need.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes a crack, then wide.  The surface of the blue marble was rippling with electric pulses against her skin.  The electric light cast ghostly shadows across the rubble that had once been a supply cupboard.  She drew back, and the ripples stopped.  She touched the wall away from the doorway, and there was no reaction.  She touched the wall in the same spot once more, this time with her unaugmented left hand, and the ripples began again.  Concentric circles spread out from her index finger and faded away.  She compared the circles one foot wide with the circles that had spread to two foot wide. At two feet wide, the expanding blue rings looked twenty-three point eight percent as bright as those at one foot wide.  The wider circles were pure white instead of blue.</p>
<p>Roberta Boyle knew precisely how many rods and cones each of her eyes contained, and re-counted them any time she couldn't sleep.  The <i>real</i> brightness of the circles two feet wide was one quarter the brightness of the circles one foot wide.  Somehow, the blue marble was drawing energy from her touch and turning it into energy and light.</p>
<p>"Diggy," she whispered.  "How far and fast can you run?"</p>
<p>This was the question she now asked her companions after every catastrophe.  She had experimented with more general questions such as "How are you?", "Are you injured?”, “How are you injured?" and -- briefly -- "What would you pay for medical attention right now?".  Her survey had indicated that a specific question about ability to escape was best.</p>
<p>"Ten miles in six hours, Professor," replied Diggy.  The pain was obvious in his voice. "I think my right leg is broken.  I could swim --"</p>
<p>"-- not far enough," she finished for him.  The North Atlantic in winter was the third coldest known object, after the coldness of Space and the ice cream that comes with a hot fudge cake.  No-one could swim to shore from this far out any more than they could finish a full Knickerbocker Glory without feeling sick.  She grimaced at the thought of swimming with a broken bone.  "The only way out is down."</p>
<p>She pressed her unaugmented hand flat against the wall.  A dull glow lit the room.  Outside, the crashing sounds of the storm continued.  Diggy eased himself to standing.  He gingerly tested the crude steel splint he had fashioned from supply cupboard wreckage and his cummerbund.  It would serve.</p>
<p>Professor Roberta Boyle pressed her left hand more firmly against the wall and took one step through the blue marble doorway.  A blue marble staircase dropped away in front of her, curving down the inside of the oil rig pillar.  A broad stair rail was set into the left, exterior, wall.  Another enormous wave struck the outside of the pillar.  More concrete and steel debris dropped from the ceiling of the supply cupboard.  They had only minutes before the pillar collapsed.</p>
<p>"Walking down those stairs with a broken leg would take you hours," observed Boyle.  "And we have only minutes before the pillar collapses."</p>
<p>Diggy nodded sadly.  "It's been a pleasure serving you, Professor," he said in his soft Norfolk accent.  "If you would give this gold anklet," and here Diggy produced a glowing gold anklet from one of his many pockets, "to my daughter Augusta, should you return to London alive -- <i>oof!</i>"</p>
<p>Professor Roberta Boyle had picked up her manservant in a fireman's carry and leaped on to the broad handrail.  She leant into the blue marble exterior wall and started to slide downwards.  The titanium nails in her boots raised sparks as she gathered speed.  The contact of the back of her left wrist with the blue marble exterior wall left a spreading glow that they soon outpaced.  An observer would have seen a comet's tail stretching out behind a scientist that was grinding down a blue marble stair rail, her injured manservant across her back.  Energy sparked and crackled around them, casting light where none had shone for a thousand years.</p>
<p>And in the depths of the Temple of Hari-varṣa Guhaa, something began to stir.  Something made of chrome and clay.</p>
<p>Something old.</p>
<p>Something lonely.</p>
<p>Something with far, far too many teeth.</p>
