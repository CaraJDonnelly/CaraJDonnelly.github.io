<p>Professor Boyle wrenched open the yellow-and-black striped door and slammed it shut behind her, and the stone walls rattled as dislodged tiles fell to the ground.  The creature had been no more than ten steps behind her.  She rapidly prototyped an experimental procedure that would determine whether the wheel in the centre of the door controlled a lock that would hold out a pursuing monster.</p>
<p>She turned the wheel tight to the right and prayed.</p>
<p>The bony clicking of the creature's feet rattled up to the door.  A hideous, jerky scraping noise began, but the wheel did not turn and the door did not open.  The creature was locked outside, and she was trapped --</p>
<p>-- in a dry, gloomy chamber with a mirrored high ceiling whose image looked sharper than reality.   The chamber was long and square, with stone seats set before stone tables.  There was only one door.  There was a feeling of intense privacy.</p>
<p>The Professor unhooked from her belt her hardback copy of Kirby's <i>Introduction to Entomology</i>.  She tossed it to the ground.  The resulting impact echoed around the chamber.  She then took her hardback copy of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's <i>World of Religion: The Holiest Bits Of The Holiest Books</i>.  She tossed that to the ground next to her copy of Kirby.  The echoes from the impact of the second book were louder.</p>
<p>"More like a church than a library," she murmured to herself.  She tried to breathe quieter.  This is impossible, even for a scientist.</p>
<p>Upon the largest table stood an enormous carving of a man's head wearing a crown with six spikes.  The enormous head had an enormous moustache carved out of a thousand stone hairs.  Before the carving lay eight ruby-red spheres.  The floor was damp.</p>
<p>Professor Boyle stood before the giant face and drew a deep breath.  One of the eight spheres was glowing.  The tunnels had been warm, but this chamber was stifling.  She stepped forwards, her sealskin boots splashing in the shallow puddles.</p>
<p>She leaned forwards onto the large stone table, and gently touched the glowing orb with her unaugmented hand.  It pulsed with a mesmerising rhythm.  The enormous moustache writhed and slithered.  The enormous face creaked open its enormous eyes.  She shifted her feet slightly in the gathering water, and peered deep into the orb.</p>
<p>------------</p>
<p>Digsworth Aberforth of Norfolk found the memory he had been looking for.  He placed the damp thermite on the tunnel floor in front of him and began to remember.</p>
<p><i>"If you must dry explosives in a hurry," croaked Reader Trismegistus, "lie down, roll up your jumper and slap it on your belly.  Body heat.  Body heat."  Reader Trismegistus looked up at a noise at the tutoring hall door.  "Ah!  Lemon cake!  Capital, capital.  Bring it in, bring it in."</i></p>
<p><i>The lemon cake was moist as a breath of thick fog.  It held together on the fork but melted in the mouth when combined with a sip of Darjeeling tea.  You could tell that real lemons had --</i></p>
<p>Digsworth Aberforth opened his eyes, releasing the memory of the delicious lemon cake.</p>
<p>Someone tapped him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>------------</p>
<p>Chrome feet clicking on stone floors.  An impression of a segmented tail that resolved into broad, flexible shoulders.  The monster threw back its head and screamed in frustration.</p>
<p>The temple walls were barely glowing.  In the darkness it was impossible to see the length of the monster’s thrashing tail.  It tensed its body, held still for a moment, then flung its entire body at the door through which the intruder had fled.  There was a deafening clang on impact, and the door shifted a fraction.</p>
<p>The monster screamed again, and prepared to fling itself at the door again.</p>
<p>------------</p>
<p>The ocean.  For a long time, the ocean.  Nothing else.</p>
<p>------------</p>
<p>Professor Boyle blinked.</p>
<p>The orb had gone dark.  Her muscles ached.  She shifted her feet to stretch her calves, and discovered she was torso deep in ice-cold ocean water.  Quickly she donned her warm leather gloves.</p>
<p>Hours had passed since she first looked into the orb.  Water had been trickling from the tiled walls since she slammed the chamber door.  The monster was still screaming outside, and as she watched the door buckled under a vicious.  Her immediate options were limited to drowning, freezing, or being ripped apart.  She grinned.</p>
<p>She quickly discovered that the orb was activated by touch and granted the ability to view remote locations.  By manipulating the orb with her hands she could direct the location.   While active the water swirled and flowed <i>into</i> the orb and out to the remote location -- unless she directed the orb to view into the external ocean.  In that case the flow reversed and even more water flowed into the chamber through the orb’s surface.  She quickly further discovered that the orb was impervious to punches, head-butts and being bitten.  Stabbing the portal had resulted in her Bowie knife going straight through and falling out of sight.</p>
<p>What was the difference between a knife and a gloved hand?  Another crash came the other side of the door.</p>
<p>Knives are bladed.  Hands are not.  Knives are long and thin.  Hands are not.  Knives are made of metal.  Hands are not --</p>
<p>She pulled off her left leather glove and flicked the fingers of her right hand.  The orb flickered to reveal Diggy, half naked, rubbing thermite on his belly.  She plunged her augmented hand through the surface of the orb into the space beyond.</p>
<p>------------</p>
<p>It was the Professor's disembodied hand that had tapped him on the shoulder.  Diggy recognised it by the heavy gold ring of Sindri on her wrist.  The ring of Sindri can split itself into nine gold rings, each as heavy as the original, making it invaluable for landing hot air balloons.  Diggy had lost count of how many gold rings he had thrown at Paris over the years.</p>
<p>The Professor's augmented hand tensed and clicked all its fingers in quick succession.</p>
<p>"<i>Ingxubakaxaka</i>."</p>
<p>That had sounded almost like a word.  The Professor's fingers clicked again.</p>
<p>"<i>Ingxubakaxaka</i>."</p>
<p>Diggy grabbed the wax-wrapped matches and handed them to the Professor.</p>
<p>------------</p>
<p>The Professor took her hands off the orb.  It deactivated.  Finding an Xhosan word for 'fire' that she could pronounce using only the fingers of one hand had taken valuable time.  Somewhere there must be another exit to this chamber.  She would discover it or drown.</p>
<p>She struck one of the matches match.  She held it aloft and began wading around chamber wall.  The water was as cold as a Latin teacher’s reproving gaze.  Her muscles were beginning to seize up.  She struck another match when the first burned out, then another after that and third still after that.  In the north-east corner her flame flickered.  She climbed on to a stone chair and the flame lengthened by a sixteenth of an inch.  She held it higher and it lengthened further.  Her last match burned out.</p>
<p>She reached out and stroked the mirrored roof of the chamber.  Her fingers found the barest of gaps.  Pressing her mouth to it she breathed air that was not fresh, but was not quite stale.  It could be a way out.  She needed to widen the gap.  The water was up to her neck.</p>
<p>With agonising slowness she swam back to the enormous stone head.  She wrenched a single stone hair from the enormous moustache.  She swam back to the stone chair beneath the air gap.  She thrust the stone hair into the gap and levered as hard as she could.</p>
<p>The mirrored ceiling shattered, and fell --</p>
