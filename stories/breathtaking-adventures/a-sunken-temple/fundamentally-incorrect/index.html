<p>Vice-chancellor Roberta Boyle, wisest person to have ever re-founded a university, looked at the back of her hand and frowned.  Her hand was fundamentally incorrect.  This demanded investigation.</p>
<p><i>Fundamentally incorrect</i>. She considered the words she had chosen.  <i>As in, incorrect in its fundament, or basis.  What would Digsworth suggest, were he present?</i></p>
<p>She was stood in a recently-flooded chamber whose floor was covered in glass shards.  The shards were from the ceiling mirror she recalled shattering several moments prior.  One of these shards of mirror was now embedded in her gut.  The water had drained out through the open chamber door when it had been broken down by the monster now shambling towards her with its claws unsheathed.  She needed to act.</p>
<p>"I need to act.  Discover, Invent, Recontextualise, Diversify, Retreat, Disguise or Plan," she recited.  And my chosen random number is... three."</p>
<p>With all of her considerable intellect, Vice-Chancellor Boyle recontextualised as hard as she could.</p>
<p>She was <i>not</i> mere seconds away from being disembowelled by a shambling monster with clicking teeth, and she did <i>not</i> have blood pouring from a wound in her side where a shard of Atlantean mirror had pierced her when she fell.  <i>Recontextualise</i>.  A shambling monster with clicking teeth was mere seconds from disembowelling her, even though she already had a blood pouring from a wound in her side from a shard of Atlantean mirror.  <i>Recontextualise</i> again.  A monster might be thinking "I am mere seconds away from disembowelling an intruder.".</p>
<p>She looked into its eyes to check.</p>
<p>She saw anger, hatred, and sharp claws heading straight for her belly.  She dodged behind an Atlantean Control Head with an enormous moustache.  She wondered briefly when she had begun knowing about Atlantean Control Heads.  How had she known the shard of mirror embedded in her gut was Atlantean?  She shook her head and focused on the situation at hand.  <i>Recontextualise</i>.</p>
<p>A monster is seconds away from leaping bodily on top of and biting into the face of, not an intruder, but a <i>murderer</i>.  She had once tutored convicted murderers in Practical Human Biology at Lord Solent's experimental Rectory (in retrospect a terrible mistake).  The look in the monster's eyes could be the look of loathing one directs at a murderer.</p>
<p>She looked into its eyes to check.</p>
<p>She saw hurt, betrayal, and a gaping maw about to clench its sharp teeth on her face.  She ducked under a low stone table whose patina showed it dated from around twenty thousand years ago.  The wound in her gut itched and burned.</p>
<p><i>Recontextualise</i>.</p>
<p>She had entered the temple unarmed except for the various knives and explosives all adventuring Vice-Chancellors carried.  Her office was apparent in the Vice-Chancellery medallion she wore at all times.  She had not murdered anyone.   She considered how old and abandoned the temple appeared.   It was unlikely anyone had murdered anyone here for thousands of years.  This monster’s actions were irrational.</p>
<p>She looked into its eyes to check.</p>
<p>She saw grief past the point of reason.  Its eyes bulged with red tears, its teeth shuddered as if each was individually afraid.  Its long claws clicked and rolled with tension.  It reared up on its hind legs and raised its right claw on high to strike her down.  Vice-Chancellor Boyle had only one choice.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," she said, and pulled the shard of Atlantean mirror clear out of her abdomen.  Red blood gushed out.  In a quick motion she flicked the glass shard up across and into the monster's throat.  Black blood gushed out and mingled with her red blood.  The monster fell forwards.</p>
<p>The world shifted.</p>
<p>Professor Boyle leaped back and clutched at her Vice-Chancellery medallion.  It wasn't there.  It had never been there.  She had never been a Vice-Chancellor of New Manchester New University.  That memory was fundamentally incorrect.  Her eyes were dragged to the back of her unaugmented hand.  Her hand was correct.  She straightened her back and began to speak.</p>
<p>"I Discover that being stabbed in the gut with a shard of Atlantean mirror brings one closer to Perfection, at the cost of being stabbed in the gut with a shard of mirror," she announced.  One must always announce Discoveries, even if your only audience was an insane monster you had just stabbed with a shard of Atlantean mirror --</p>
<p>-- she did a neat forwards tumble on her augmented right hand and landed astride the monster's left shoulder.  She gasped from the pain in her abdomen but dismissed it as unimportant.  She needed to know whether the monster was alive, dead, or Perfect.</p>
<p>She looked into its eyes to check.</p>
<p>She stroked open the monster's eyelids.   Its dark eyes focused on her.  It held her gaze for a long second.  Then it relaxed beneath her.  Blood red tears ran freely down its scaly cheeks as black blood poured from its throat.  It exhaled, once.  It did not breathe again.</p>
