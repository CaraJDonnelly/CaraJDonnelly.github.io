<p>Hoskote town is damp in the late summer air; condensation runs down red stone and white paint alike. The air carries a steady low hum of moving steel from the factories, and an equally steady smell of peppery pumpkin broth. Over this a mossy green breeze whispers from the southeast and the streets are cut by sharp tongues of lime and colocasia. It is Sunday, the day of men with toothy joyful smiles selling every sort of thing one might ever want. The crowds stream past them, and bright painted trucks and the buses from Bangalore rumble on nearby streets.</p>
<p>Navya is a 32 year old packrat who has filled her flat with bric-a-brac - several chipped teapots, a rescued neon pink shisha pipe, and creased film posters that cover the walls. Her clothes are bright and worn with years of wear, and her plump, quick smile flaps her cheeks like clean sheets in the wind. She is crying angry tears.</p>
<p>Her newest toy over the last few months has been a smartphone, a phone that can display maps and connect to the Internet. She boasted about the freedom it gave her from the cafe down the street, and each week downloaded a new app to play with. Like everyone her age, she used BitCoin to buy coffee and beer now, as well as weed deliveries from the Sheep Marketplace; in the evenings she would speculate, buying more if she thought the price was low and selling if she thought the price was high, and some days most of her ready cash was virtual. Today, her BitCoin app had updated with a cute feature that displayed how many BitCoins she had in her wallet compared to the average user of the app, and what percentile she came in the rankings of BitCoin wealth.</p>
<p>Her phone was still displaying 0%, on the other side of the room where she had thrown it against the wall. Too many Europeans, too many Japanese, too many Americans, their petty cash twenty times as much as everything bitter Jiya had. Her boyfriend, Pranit, is stuttering like an old car with a new owner, his kind face creased by confusion.</p>
<p>``I d-don't und-erstand, Jiya,'' he says, sitting before her with his hands gently on her arms. ``What's wrong?''</p>
<p>Jiya shakes her head, her red eyes opening only briefly to glare at the wooden floor. Everything is wrong, she wants to scream, when I work hard and you work harder and all I have doesn't even count, you and I don't count, you'll never be a politician and I'll never be a scientist and no-one will even notice that we failed. She swallowed painfully, and asked a hard question.</p>
<p>``Pranit... are - are we poor?''</p>
<p>If they had made love, then, things would have been better in the long run. Instead Pranit just frowned, disappointed by the question, and shook his head.</p>
