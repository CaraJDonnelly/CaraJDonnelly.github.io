<p>Chapter 2<br />
----<br />
January 15th, 1948: President Martin, Jr. authorizes the use of force in Czechslovakia, leading to the arrest of 43 senior Communist ministers.<br />
----</p>
<p>Trudy's breasts were round and firm, and pressed against her sweater in a way that Palmer could not keep his eyes off.  The rest of her had black hair and blue eyes, and cracked skin on her knuckles.  She was carrying a small black rucksack, and stared at Palmer.</p>
<p>"You're the new meat?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I guess so," said Palmer, "but no-one's really told me what's going on here."  He laughed, nervously, and it echoed in the large and empty meeting hall.  "They said they thought I was a Communist."</p>
<p>"Are you?" She tensed her body as though ready to attack, and her breasts moved again underneath her sweater.</p>
<p>"Would you prefer it if I was?"  Palmer asked, essaying a wolfish grin.</p>
<p>She stayed tense, and the pleasantry fell flat.</p>
<p>"I - no, I'm not a Communist."  He shifted from foot to foot.  "Sorry."</p>
<p>"Why are you apologising to me for not being a Communist?" she spat.  "I'm not a fucking Commie."</p>
<p>The hall was constructed from four quarter-halls, each carried on the back of a flatbed truck.  In the side of one of the long walls, three quarters of the way along, there was a plain wooden door that led to the office of General Morris.  Through this doorway now a Private entered, who addressed Palmer.</p>
<p>"You are about to meet a General in the US Air Force," he announced through the empty space. "Please keep your hands visible at all times."  He turned and re-entered the General's office, closing the door behind him.</p>
<p>Palmer hesitated, and supposed that he should follow.  He opened the door and waved his hand vaguely in the direction of Trudy, inviting her to enter before him.  She did not move and stood, staring at him, until he uncomfortably entered.  The private, who was stationed just inside the door, pistol in hand at all times, closed the door behind him.</p>
<p>The meeting room was claustrophobic, with a large white projector screen at one end, and the space within the room taken up by a clutter of cheap wooden tables and folding chairs arranged haphazardly in a circle.  The floor underfoot was covered in a cheap green carpet, and the walls were the undecorated walls that one might find within a large caravan: boxy and disjointed.  Several windows had been painted over with black paint.</p>
<p>Behind the meeting table sat a man that resembled nothing so much as a squashed toad.  Behind Palmer, the private spoke.</p>
<p>"General Morris, sir!  The prisoner has arrived, sir!"</p>
<p>General Morris slowly turned his attention from the meeting table where his eyes had been resting on a bright gold statuette of a golfer that was obviously made of plastic.</p>
<p>"A prisoner?"  His wide, pale eyes tracked slowly over Palmer's face.  "I suppose you are.  You're here to work."  General Morris' expression lost focus, and slowly he returned to contemplating the statuette of a golfer.</p>
<p>Palmer found he had tangled his fingers together in his nervousness.</p>
<p>"My name is Palmer Jones, sir."</p>
<p>General Morris did not look up or respond in any way.</p>
<p>"Sir?"  Palmer made to step forwards and then noticed the private behind him was tracking him with his pistol.  He flinched, and the door to the meeting room was opened from outside.  Assuming that he had just been shot at, Palmer fell over backwards onto several chairs.</p>
<p>Dr. Ernst Schmidt trotted into the room, buzzing with barely contained energy and carrying several thick binders marked as Top Secret.  He stopped short at the sight of Palmer tangled in with the furniture, a look of dismay blossoming upon his face and only being fought back by a visible expenditure of will.  He spoke to Palmer as an adult who does not believe in children speaks to a child.</p>
<p>"Get up, now, there's a good fellow."  Schmidt did not offer him a hand, and gestured that he should sit himself down opposite General Morris.  Schmidt trotted around and sat himself off to the left hand side of the General.</p>
<p>"Now then," twinkled Dr. Schmidt, pouring out three cups of coffee. "Let us begin with the facts as we know them, and then move on to suppositions and theories.  General?"</p>
<p>The General cleared his throat and began speaking in a monotone, as though reciting a script he had learned by heart.</p>
<p>"One year ago, federal tax authorities noticed an unlisted building with no doors or windows." On the wall a projector image of a small military pillbox next to a large, leafy shrub, around the width of a swimming pool and the height of a tree.  "Naturally, they alerted the Army and the area was cordoned off.  After some preliminary investigations we sent out some feelers in the Eastern Bloc and came up empty.  Six months later, the Soviet Premier met - "</p>
<p>"Wait," said Palmer, "I don't have clearance for any of this."</p>
<p>General Morris exchanged a glance with Dr. Schmidt.</p>
<p>"You do now," he said.</p>
<p>"You've been drafted," twinkled Dr. Schmidt.</p>
<p>Palmer choked on his coffee.  "The hell I have."</p>
<p>"The draft has been reactivated, in secret, due to a national emergency.  You now have the highest level of clearance, and are subject to military law.  If you attempt to leave this base you will be shot.  If you attempt to contact anyone outside of this base, you will be shot.  If at any time you take an action inimical to the well-being of the United States and the American way of life, including fulfilling your duties unsatisfactorily, you will be shot."  The General glowered at Palmer.  "Six months ago the Soviet Premier met with the President and confirmed that the Soviets knew nothing about the Maze.  Naturally they wanted in, and naturally we've kept them out."</p>
<p>Palmer began to ask "Why is it called the Maze?" but checked himself in time.  Draft or no draft, he didn't have to play along just like that.</p>
<p>There was an awkward and lengthy pause in which General Morris stared at Palmer and got redder and redder, obviously expecting Palmer to ask why the object was called the Maze.  Eventually, Dr. Schmidt coughed.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you could tell our new friend Palmer why we're calling it the Maze."</p>
<p>General Morris nodded, still red-faced.  "This," the image became a watercolour of the previous slide, with the bush replaced by a grey splodge, "is Dr. Schmidt's painting of the Maze."</p>
<p>Palmer raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>"This," another watercolour, with the maze replaced by a collection of bright orange rocks in the shape of an igloo, "is my painting of the maze.  And this," again, with the maze replaced by a set of interlocking purple and green stripes," is Miss Short's."</p>
<p>"You might know her as Trudy."  Dr. Schmidt leaned in.  "Tell us, Palmer.  What do you see when you look at it?"</p>
<p>"Leaves.  A standard hedge maze.  I guess I'm a traditionalist."</p>
<p>Schmidt nodded.  "It's more likely a lack of imagination."</p>
<p>General Morris cleared his throat.  The image on the projector changed to show a photograph of a set of caravans in front of a hedge.</p>
<p>"The Maze is expanding as a slow exponential; every day it is one percent larger by area.  It has not been slowed by different terrain, including rivers.  It resists all explosives tried so far.  It currently covers 1.8 square miles."</p>
<p>"At its current rate of expansion it will cover the entire United States within four years."</p>
<p>There was a silence.  Palmer eventually asked "Does everyone see the Maze differently?"</p>
<p>"No; healthy people see it as I see it.  A featureless grey block, utterly impenetrable."</p>
<p>"Okay - so what links me, Trudy and Morris?  Why are we special?"</p>
<p>"It's quite simple:  You are all losers."</p>
<p>Palmer blushed, and darted a glance at Morris.  He had returned to his steady observation of his cheap plastic statuette.</p>
<p>"You do think of yourself as a loser, do you not?"</p>
<p>Palmer, embarrassed, addressed himself to General Morris.  "Looks like a terrible backswing -" he faltered, and stopped speaking.  The General had raised his eyes and was now staring at him with a look of unmistakeable hatred.  Schmidt continued speaking.</p>
<p>"I do not classify people into crude subsets.  But you do, and you think of yourself as a loser.  The good General here," jerking his thumb at the door, "thinks of himself as a loser.  It is plain that the Maze is exerting some telepathic control over you to cause you to see it as made of leaves rather than of its true substance.  You see it as leaves even in photographs, do you not?  We have tested this by taking a photograph to Australia; the effect is still present.  There is a weakness in your psyche that has allowed this object access, and it has created this illusion for you."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>Dr. Schmidt spread his hands.  "That is what you are here to find out."</p>
