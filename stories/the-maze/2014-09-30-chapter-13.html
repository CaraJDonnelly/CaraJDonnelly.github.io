TODO: Cold war timeline<br />
----</p>
<p>Blake's entourage arrived at the entrance to Grey Base.  To the North and South guard outposts were now visible - security, already tight, had been increased since the attack.  He passed his papers to the guard on duty, who checked a clipboard.</p>
<p>"Sorry, sir, I don't seem to have you down for re-entry to the base."  The guard leafed through some pages.  "In fact, I have you down as attending a briefing all the way over in DC today."</p>
<p>Blake stared at the guard coldly.</p>
<p>"Telephone High Command and request clarification."</p>
<p>The guard saluted.  "Yes, sir."  He turned to the the checkpoint telephone and Blake shot him in the side of the head.  Blake then shot by his shift partner.  He signalled to his men to advance.  The time was 0909.</p>
<p>His entourage was made up of soldiers loyal to him personally.  Blake loathed people that were not one hundred percent loyal to the US Army, but since Blake considered himself to be a mere expression of the will of the Army, above and beyond the mere following of orders, he saw these soldiers as perfect examples of what troops could be.</p>
<p>Eighty-six minutes later, everyone else in the base was dead and construction had begun.  Blake sat at ease, watching his engineers work while his sergeants gathered what few supplies they would need.  They were constructing a large extensible gurney which, when extended, would be about three times the height of a building, with detachable top section.  The body of the gurney was made from scaffolding tubes, hinged at each terminus, with a double layer of shock-absorption between its wheels and the main structure.  The detachable top section was a small cart, which again had shock-absorbers and had its own layer of wheels that were currently hanging in empty air.  Construction took precisely twenty-nine minutes and twenty-four seconds, taking them to 1104.  From Dr. Schmidt's estimates presented in Washington the Maze boundary should be approximately twenty miles West from Grey Base when they reached it, placing the gurney and cart should take fifteen minutes, and the light engine, to be raised after the payload was secure, would bring them to the centre of the object approximately one hour after that.</p>
<p>There, they would detonate the four MK-24 Teller-Ulam nuclear payloads and destroy the object.</p>
<p>Blake had considered, as all loyal commanders did, the possibility and costs of failure.  Either the alien object would succumb to the combined energy of 60 million tons of dynamite, or the US Army had no chance of standing against them and the war against these invaders was already lost.</p>
<p>He checked his watch against his battle plan.  The nearest US troops were at least two hours away in all cases, and his corresponding planning for munitions to be carried when on the surface of the Maze was correspondingly light; aside from the one excursion after the capture of their scout Palmer Jones the Maze had not been actively hostile, and that had ceased after he had escaped from the medical centre by somehow causing it to burst into flames.</p>
<p>The two-way radio at his belt crackled.  "Colonel Blake, sir!"  The sentry's voice was urgent and perhaps even slightly panicked.  Colonel Blake mentally revised his opinion of him downwards.  "The object is approaching fast from due West, sir!  ETA twelve minutes, sir!"</p>
<p>Colonel Blake sprinted for the gurney.  The payloads and light munitions were loaded, and he hoisted himself over them to sit atop them.  Up there were four engineers making fast the deadly cargo.  He took his radio and spoke.  "All men at Grey Base: the gurney must be raised immediately.  Repeat, immediately.  This is mission critical."</p>
<p>The gurney juddered and began to rise as all hands rushed to the hand-driven winches and began to turn them as quickly as they could.  The Maze rushed towards them, and with the weight of five men and four fusion bombs they would not make it high enough in time.  Blake pointed to the two smallest engineers.  "Jump."</p>
<p>They jumped, avoiding the men turning the winches below, and upon landing stood and began to help with the winching.  Blake nodded approval.  Good soldiers.</p>
<p>The Maze struck.  The outer boundary was now growing at one hundred miles an hour, and the gurney was only three-quarters raised.  The bottom section was destroyed utterly, as was the light engine.  The top section's front wheels had been raised to just above the point where the Maze struck, and was ripped from its moorings and flung through the air.</p>
<p>When Colonel Blake came to, the first thing he noticed was that he had not been killed.  The payload had not spontaneously detonated on the impact, and him landing on the surface of the Maze had not injured him significantly.  He raised himself carefully to his knees, aware that somewhere in his vicinity were four damaged nuclear bombs.</p>
<p>The nuclear cart was upright, and the bombs secure; presumably they had not been in the air long enough for the cart to tilt or for them to come loose.  The back wheels had been ripped off.  The two remaining engineers were waking up nearby.  Both had been knocked unconscious but seemed otherwise unhurt.</p>
<p>He stood, and slowly walked over to the cart and checked its rear axle.  The ground was flat, grey and solid, like impossibly smooth rock.  He motioned to the engineers, and they came over.  One of them was looking slightly green, and gestured towards the floor.</p>
<p>"Those men that were down there - are they - ?"</p>
<p>Blake ignored the question.  "You, lift under the left rear wheel rim.  You, lift under the right rear wheel rim.  I will take the axle."</p>
<p>The men hesitated, then obeyed.  Together, the three of them set off towards the centre.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Palmer could not see.  The Green Berberis had given way to thick Holm Oak, which had given way to young blackthorn, which had now given way to mature autumn holly bush, the dark waxy leaves so thick as to block any light.  There were no longer any gaps; he was having to push his way through bodily.  He had several hours before deliberately chosen to stop thinking; the centre was the only distinguished point in this Maze, if Maze it could still be called.</p>
<p>He paused for breath and to assess his problems.  Most of all he was worried that - in near-perfect darkness - he was unable to find his way to the centre.  He tilted his head upwards to make certain he could not see the Sun.  The leaves rustled, and thickened in response.</p>
<p>A voice came through the darkness, very muffled.</p>
<p>"Palmer?" It was Trudy.  "Is that you?"</p>
<p>"Trudy!" He called.  "I'm over here!  Are you OK?"</p>
<p>"I'm fine," she said.  "Why are you bleeding so much?"</p>
<p>"You can see me through the bushes?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I don't see your Maze," she said.</p>
<p>"Could you help me through?" he called out.</p>
<p>"Don't shout," she replied, her voice hard to hear through the leaves.  "I can hear you just fine."</p>
<p>"Could you lead me through your Maze to the centre?" he repeated.</p>
<p>There was silence.  He continued.</p>
<p>"My Maze has closed up.  There's no pathway at all.  I'm worried I'll overshoot."</p>
<p>"Your Maze is just solid leaves, now?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"OK," she answered.  "Follow my voice."</p>
<p>He pushed his way forwards as she began reciting her times tables in a monotone voice.  He strained to hear her, ready to turn off to either side when she turned, following the twists and turns of her Maze which to him was quite invisible.  She did not turn once, but instead led him in a straight line.  Eventually they reached the ditch, and he begged to rest.</p>
<p>"We're almost there," she said.</p>
<p>"I can't push any further."</p>
<p>"I'll pull you, then."  She took his good hand, now covered in deep lacerations from the holly bushes, and gripped it tightly.  She began to pull him, hard.  Her concept of the Maze, then, had not been growing and becoming denser as his had, or she would have been unable to move so quickly and freely.</p>
<p>If he opened his mouth to cry out at the pain the holly leaves cut at his lips and the soft edges of his cheeks on his large face.  He could not open his eyes, nor had he been able to would he have been able to see his own hand stretched out before him being pulled by Trudy.  He imagined that she moved through the holly as a ghost might, unremarked upon and uninteresting to the presence that dominated his world.</p>
<p>Suddenly he was free.  He pitched forwards at the sudden lack of pressure and vomited freely, blood streaming down his face, clutching the pedestal that was at the centre of the Maze as though it was a rope that held him to a world where things made sense.  For almost half an hour he lay there, unmoving, waiting for the pain to subside.</p>
<p>"You look worse than ever, kid." said Trudy.</p>
<p>TODO:  From Trudy's perspective, going to find Blake.  Maybe she went to get medical supplies, maybe she just fucked off to have some time to herself.<br />
---</p>
<p>Blake saw the fighter planes before either of the engineers.  He called a halt and climbed into the cart.  Straddling one of the fusion bombs, he opened the munitions bag and removed a small rocket launcher and two Colt automatic rifles with box magazines.</p>
<p>"Get into the cart," he ordered.  "They'll have to be more accurate if we're sitting right on the payload."</p>
<p>So it proved.  With the fighter planes unwilling to fire directly at the nuclear weapons they were forced to come in on long, low strafing runs running directly at their position, and aiming so carefully and firing in such short bursts that none of their rounds struckthe three men.  Blake and his engineers, on the other hand, were given excellent opportunity to fire as the planes came straight towards them with no cover, and managed to shoot dead two of the pilots in their cockpits.  Those planes left pilot-less continued sedately overhead to land on the surface of the Maze, their landings oddly quiet as the near-black surface did not scratch or vibrate underneath them.  Eventually the fighter planes broke off the fruitless attack and pulled away into the sky.</p>
<p>"By the time the paratroopers arrive we need to be in position," said Blake, climbing down.  The engineers joined him, and one of them collapsed from fatigue.</p>
<p>"Pick him up," he said to the other, just in time to see him collapse as well.  There was blood on his forehead.</p>
<p>Everything went black.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>"I'm back," said Trudy.  "You still alive, kid?"</p>
<p>"Where did you go?"</p>
<p>She didn't answer but instead perched on the edge of the pedestal.  He could feel her eyes on him, and tried to look up to meet them.  He couldn't.</p>
<p>"I can't see.  The leaves have cut my eyes."  He moaned, a long a cry of real pain, and the leaves nearby rustled in response.  "I wanted to see your eyes."</p>
<p>Trudy was silent for a while, then stood up and started walking away.</p>
<p>"Wait!  Please," he cried.  "I'm dying."</p>
<p>He was dying, and he had wanted to see her eyes, although he had realised neither of these things until he had said them aloud.<br />
Trudy's footsteps on the grass approached him again.</p>
<p>"Why are you dying?"</p>
<p>He shook his head.  "Look at me."</p>
<p>"They're just cuts.  You'll heal."</p>
<p>"No, I mean, look at me.  Look me," and once again he started to chuckle with an edge of madness, "in the eyes."  He pulled himself to his feet with his good hand, leaning heavily against the stone pedestal still, and sat on its edge.  "I'm blind, with all my teeth pulled out and no right hand, and everyone thinks I'm either mentally handicapped or an alien.  There's no way I could go back to my old life, even if I wanted to.  This Maze is the only place I'm welcome, and I don't think I could even make it out again.  Do you think I'm staying alive?  If nothing else, what would I eat?"</p>
<p>Trudy was right next to him, but her voice was flat and distant.  "Suicide is for losers."</p>
<p>He paused.  "Talk to me, Trudy.  My ears are still good."</p>
<p>"I killed Blake."</p>
<p>He flinched in surprise.  "When?"</p>
<p>"Just now.  He was coming here with two guys and a big wheelbarrow full of what looked like bombs."  Her voice became introspective.  "Looked real funny, just floating there, walking on nothing.  His feet kept fuzzing out, like smoke was boiling off them and falling down, like the world couldn't decide whether he was falling or not."  Her voice got louder as her head turned towards him.  "There are planes about a mile that way, on fire, just floating in midair, not touching anything at all.  Black smoke from the fires going up and black smoke from the world going down."</p>
<p>"You can see them from here?"</p>
<p>"Sure.  They're huge."</p>
<p>Palmer shifted slightly, his entire body wet with blood from ten thousand tiny cuts.  "What shape is your Maze, Trudy?"  He began to shrug his backpack off to reach the water he had stored there - it had been completely inaccessible whilst traversing the Maze.  "Trudy?"</p>
<p>She shifted too.  "You know, it's purple and yellow blocks."</p>
<p>"Does it move around like mine?"</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>"And the gaps between the walls are so big the planes aren't touching them at all?"  Palmer had found a bottle of water, but his crippled hand wouldn't unclench to open it and his formerly good hand was slick with blood and starting to swell up.  He held it out to Trudy, and she took it, opened it and returned it.  Trudy did not answer his question.  He ran the knuckles of his crippled hand over the surface of the pedestal, enjoying the cool rough stone against his skin.</p>
<p>"Was there always a groove down the middle of this?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."  Trudy stood again.  "Come on, let's go.  You need to see a doctor.  It's only a few miles."</p>
<p>Palmer frowned.  "A few miles?  It took all day to walk here."  He rubbed at his bloody gums with his better hand.  Curious, he softly repeated his question.  "What shape is your Maze, Trudy?"</p>
<p>Trudy finally spoke.</p>
<p>"I have no fucking clue what you - any of you - are talking about."  She growled in genuine anger.  "How did you cut yourself walking through empty space?  I was standing watching you and watching the cuts appear.  There's nothing here.  There's never been anything here."</p>
<p>Palmer hesitated "I can see -"</p>
<p>"I know what you can see.  I've heard you describe it.  I've seen the pictures you all drew, watched you all fumble your way around like homeless street artists from New York who won't get to eat tonight if you don't pretend really, really hard.  I don't give a shit.  No-one gave me a fucking stuffed toy just because I wandered around a field for five hours.</p>
<p>"I thought you might be different, Palmer.  You didn't seem like a massive prick like Schmidt, or a pathetic drunk like Morris.  But look at you.  You're some piece of work, to imagine yourself your very own torture factory.  You getting off on that pain?"</p>
<p>"No," he replied, honestly.</p>
<p>"Bullshit."</p>
<p>They sat in silence for a long time.  More planes passed overhead, their engines buzzing.  He drank some water; she refused it when offered.</p>
<p>"You really don't see anything here?"</p>
<p>"No," she spat.</p>
<p>"Well, shit."</p>
<p>He sat in the dark and quiet, her body heat close enough to feel on the pedestal edge, and thought about the times they had fucked.  He felt a little nostalgic - he had meant what he said about dying.  Unless Trudy carried him there was no way he was getting to the edge again, and if it had been expanding at the rate he had seen before he didn't think he would survive even being carried.  There is only so much pain the human body can tolerate.</p>
<p>"Shit," he said again.  "What's the nearest city?"</p>
<p>"Portland," she answered.  "Where I'm from."</p>
<p>"The Maze is expanding at around 40 miles per hour.  By now it might be almost there."</p>
<p>"Do you think it would help if I shot the pedestal?"</p>
<p>"Worth a try."</p>
<p>They backed up, him leaning against the prickly leaves, her a little further into the empty field.  She fired past him at an angle, so that the ricochet went safely into the distance, and kept firing until she'd emptied the clip of Byrne's pistol.</p>
<p>"Not even a dent," she reported.  They sat back down.  "I can see the pedestal.  That's something."</p>
<p>"Yeah."  His leg brushed against something, which on exploration with his hands turned out to be Trudy's satchel.  "Hah.  Is this really your ex-boyfriend's head in here?"</p>
<p>"Yes," she answered, shortly.  She picked up the satchel and put it behind him on the pedestal.  "He deserved it."</p>
<p>The wind whispered.</p>
<p>"Place of skulls," he said, vaguely, hoping to change the conversation.</p>
<p>"Yeah," she said, agreeing.  "It's going to cover everything, right?  We'll all be buried under this thing."</p>
<p>"Not you," he said.  She shrugged.</p>
<p>"Who cares?  If it kills all but one out of every thousand people, do you think I'll survive the chaos?  Do you think the Russians won't take advantage of it somehow?"</p>
<p>"Live on stilts," he said, and smiled at the image of Communists on stilts waiting for the hedges to devour the ground beneath their feet.  "Nowhere to grow food, topside."</p>
<p>"Maybe they could take soil up with them, or have someone like me pass it up to them."</p>
<p>"It'd just fall through, wouldn't it?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>They sat in silence for a while longer.  The air was fresh, the cool stone beneath them pleasantly rough, and there was no pressure to stay alive.  The hedge wall shimmered and advanced upon Palmer, pushing him backwards until he was sat right in the middle of the stone pedestal.</p>
<p>"Place of skulls," she muttered.  His fingers continued idly wandering over the pedestal surface.  She answered his unasked question.  "The pedestal carving is of a flower.  A white one.  The white is marble laid into the granite."</p>
<p>"Every time I make a good decision, the Maze has gotten denser," he said.  "What do good decisions have to do with white flowers?"</p>
<p>"Can you tell what a good decision is by seeing if the Maze gets denser?" she asked.  "Because that way, you could decide different things were the correct answer and see if the Maze gets denser as a result."</p>
<p>"I don't think that would work," he replied.  "It's not got that sense about it."</p>
<p>She stood and kissed him gently.  It was pleasant, and suited the mien of the afternoon perfectly.</p>
<p>He sighed.  "I think I have to die."</p>
<p>She stood back, and in the pause of the wind he fancied he could hear her lashes move as she blinked.  Eventually, her hair rustled as she nodded.  "Seems likely, don't it?"</p>
<p>He nodded back.</p>
<p>"Should I go get more bullets?"</p>
<p>He hesitated.  "I don't think I'll need bullets.  I think I just have to... accept it."</p>
<p>"Would you like another kiss?"</p>
<p>He shifted in his place on the granite pedestal; sitting crosslegged for more than a little while had never been comfortable.  "Maybe just hold my hand."</p>
<p>She took a hold of his good hand, then his ruined one.</p>
<p>"Ready?"  He asked.</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>Palmer Jones considered himself.  He considered the Maze.  He considered life.  He accepted death.</p>
