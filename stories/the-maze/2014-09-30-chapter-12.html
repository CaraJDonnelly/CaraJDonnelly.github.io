<p>It was dark again when he awoke.  Everything hurt, but his mind felt clearer.  The Jeep was parked outside of a lonely farmhouse, and a commotion was coming from within.</p>
<p>A man and woman came out, followed by Rogers with a .22 AutoMag pistol.  Rogers gestured, and through the glass of the Jeep cab Palmer heard angry words.  The man and woman were shaking, and slowly they knelt.  Palmer almost fell out the cab door in his haste, and hurried around the car.  Rogers was shaking too, through exhaustion and undischarged anger, and almost didn't notice that Palmer had stepped in front of the gun.  He blinked.</p>
<p>"Get out of the way."</p>
<p>Palmer shook his head, his eye seeping pus.</p>
<p>"You going to die for these people?  This bullet will go right through you and kill them anyway."</p>
<p>"I'm not going to die for them," said Palmer, "because I know you're not going to shoot.  This isn't you, Rogers."</p>
<p>Rogers wavered, then staggered, the last of his strength deserting him.  Palmer smoothly stepped forwards and took the gun from his relaxed hand.  "I'm sorry," he said to the couple.  "He hasn't been sleeping well."</p>
<p>At the sight of him, his ruined face and hand and a gun in his grasp, they stood as one and backed away.  He gestured for a moment, wanting them not to run, then let them go.  There was really nothing that could be said that was both honest and reassuring,</p>
<p>He looked down at Rogers.  He was asleep, and the smell of rum rolled off him.  Palmer supposed he might be lucky to still be alive, having ridden in a Jeep with him driving all night.  He slowly and painfully began to drag him indoors.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>A white horse had only dry hay, and so ate, regretfully.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>TODO: Cut away here?  Possibly to see what Schmidt is doing.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>"Why did the Maze start growing so fast?" he asked Rogers.  They were sprawled in the large kitchen of the house.  Rogers had insisted on going upstairs and bringing down all the soft furnishings from upstairs - the duvets, the sheets and blankets - and had spread them across the table, chairs and sideboards.  He had then found the liquor cabinet and taken in enough to maintain his level of drunkenness.</p>
<p>"Why did it start growing like that?" Palmer repeated.  "When Byrne died, it started going crazy.  Roots going everywhere.  But Schmidt said that someone had died in there before."</p>
<p>"Trudy," muttered Rogers.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Trudy.  She killed someone in there.  Her old husband.  She cut off his head and carried it around in a bag."</p>
<p>"That was her Curse," said Palmer.  "It wasn't real."</p>
<p>"What's a Curse?"</p>
<p>"It's a thing you get the first time you complete the Maze.  You have to carry it around with you."</p>
<p>Rogers considered this for a moment, then took another swallow of Seagram's gin.  "You get it when you first complete the Maze?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"Then it wasn't a Curse.  She was there six, eight months - right from the start - and she didn't have it then.  It was only when lover boy tried to walk out on her that they were having to carry his corpse out of there without a head, and her screaming like a wildcat that it was hers and they weren't going to take it away from her.  She was nuts but they couldn't get rid of her because she could go inside - the only one for a long time."</p>
<p>Palmer fell silent and stretched across the lime green wool blanket he was sat upon.  He hated limes, but wool was a nice change.  Life had been stressful recently.</p>
<p>"Fuck it," said Palmer.  "Let's stay here for a week."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>They stayed there for five days.  There was food, and running water, and when the patrols came past, sweeping the area for remaining civilians, they hid in the cellar and drank peach schnapps.</p>
<p>Rogers had joined the army to be like the King, he said, meaning Presley.  Palmer had never tried to get military funding for his education because he felt he'd seen enough death from his parents.  Neither of them had been particularly happy with their choices.</p>
<p>Palmer's wounds were scarring over, and in one of the old boxes in the attic they found several sets of dentures, one of which fit him better than the set Palmer had swiped from the Grey Base medical centre.  The house, so isolated from civilisation, had good stocks of food and painkillers.  They spent a day shooting a tree with a shotgun.  It had crab apples growing in it.  Neither of them liked crab apples, and they had a good time.</p>
<p>"I should go back," said Palmer.</p>
<p>"Back to DC?"</p>
<p>"Back to the Maze."</p>
<p>Rogers jerked with surprise and Palmer ducked as the shotgun bucked in his hands.  Rogers stared at him with incredulity, and Palmer carried on speaking.</p>
<p>"It's not over.  It's obviously not over, and that thing is still growing.  You and I are both criminals - I'm a hostile space alien now - and you even think they're going to nuke it."</p>
<p>"They won't nuke it.  If they nuke it they'll have to blame the Soviets," said Rogers.</p>
<p>"Right."  Palmer picked up a rock and threw it at the injured tree.  "Then we all die anyway.  And it's only me and Trudy that can go in -"</p>
<p>"They'll find others that could go in," interjected Rogers.</p>
<p>"-after that slime ball Schmidt tells them all about how I promised an invasion?  They aint gonna let no-one near that thing, no-how," said Palmer, semi-consciously mimicking Rogers' southern drawl.</p>
<p>"So?"  Rogers hefted and aimed the shotgun again.  "Let's just drive down to New Mexico and drink and play poker."</p>
<p>"That's not the point." Palmer hesitated, searching for words. "To just give up.  To turn away.  That's not living."</p>
<p>"Whatever."  He loosed a round, and the tree released shards of wood chips in all directions.  "Not living's still better than dying."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>/A sunny room with a journal on the desk by the window.  The journal is down to its last pages, filled with sad scrawled writing, and next to it is the next volume.  The blank pages are beautiful./</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Blake silently left the debriefing room.  It was clear to him that the Generals he had been speaking to did not believe him or Schmidt when they described the scale of the threat.  One of them had ordered that he undergo a psychological evaluation.</p>
<p>Blake was a Colonel, and had been a Colonel for as long as he could remember.  There had been five Generals in that room.  If he didn't act then they would all die as the alien menace - the Grey Menace, Schmidt had been calling it - advanced across the nation.  To save them he would have to kill - he did a quick calculation - approximately one million civilians, five hundred rank-and-file and non-commissioned officers, twenty low-ranking officers, several specialist technicians that might alert Command to his plan before he was finished, and one Colonel.  He would also have to disobey several orders.</p>
<p>Five Generals, plus the President, and even the rest of the Armed Forces.  The arithmetic was clear.</p>
<p>"Driver," he said.  "Take me to the Minnesota Nuclear Stockpile Facility."  He began running over the plan in his mind.  "There's something I need to collect."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Palmer Jones drove the Jeep slowly and carefully towards the Maze.  By this time all military personnel had been evacuated well past the farmhouse where they had been staying and the air was silent, carrying only a heavy dead heat.  He had risen before Rogers that morning, and set out.  On the seat beside him was sat Jimjim the bear, and it was to him Palmer addressed his words.</p>
<p>"Sad about him, Jimjim."  He had the wrist of his bad hand on the wheel and his good hand drumming on the chassis of the door, the window down and the wind blowing freely.  Jimjim was strapped in, and did not mind the wind.</p>
<p>"Life isn't for running away from," he said, vaguely.  His thoughts drifted to the behaviour of the Maze.</p>
<p>"It started growing fast after they killed Byrne.  But Rogers said that Trudy - that Trudy had killed someone already in there."  He mulled.  "Is it something to do with killing dispassionately?"</p>
<p>Jimjim didn't reply.</p>
<p>"No, I don't think so either."</p>
<p>Cornfields passed.  The Jeep ran out of gas, and Palmer let it coast to a stop.  There was more in the trunk, and bottled water, too, and he continued to speak, now addressing the dry air, as he carefully poured the gasoline into the tank.</p>
<p>"It wasn't the death that triggered the growth."  He sighed.  "I went back to Grey Base to tell them something that wasn't even true." He thought a bit more and snorted.  "Bet Schmidt would still have shocked me whatever I'd said, anyway, even if I had been right."</p>
<p>He drove on.  "There was still growth, Jimjim.  When the soldiers started shooting and I had to run for cover, that's when the growth really started."</p>
<p>Jimjim's silence was more introspective, now, rather than judgemental.</p>
<p>"Was it protecting me?"  It seemed wrong, somehow.  "It crippled my hand."</p>
<p>He caught a glimpse of himself in the rear-view mirror, and again coasted to a stop.  "Who am I anyway, Jimjim?"</p>
<p>Jimjim's silence was that of a friend shrugging.  Palmer shrugged back and started the Jeep again.  It was running less smoothly than it had been before he refilled it, and he had a flash of memory where his father warned him about the dregs of the last fuel tank gumming up the engine.</p>
<p>"A loser" was what Schmidt had called him, and Morris, and Trudy.  One an alcoholic obsessed with his ex-wife, one who responded to betrayal with murder, and him.  Would a loser have gone back to try to tell people about the Maze changing, right or wrong?</p>
<p>Would Palmer have even bothered to avoid the bullets six months ago?  A disturbing thought.</p>
<p>Palmer and Jimjim shared a lunch of a tin of tomatoes and some dry crackers - the house hadn't been low on supplies but Palmer hadn't wanted to take more than he had needed since he was already taking the Jeep without asking.  He had left a note explaining what he had done.</p>
<p>Eventually, they came to the Maze edge - again, the maze was no longer one continuous block but was here made of disconnected tall hedges radiating outwards, and Palmer parked the Jeep, leaving it unlocked.  Spotter planes had started to pass overhead and Palmer was conscious that he had been quite lucky to pass this far without being noticed.  Two were coming his way and so, without thinking, he stepped within the Maze boundary to be concealed by its curious telepathic effect.</p>
<p>Immediately the hedges burst outwards and started tearing up the ground, sprouting as though it had always been hidden just below the surface.  Startled, Palmer ran as quickly as he could past the Jeep and managed to outdistance the outer boundary.  The growth immediately slowed back to its previous sedate pace.</p>
<p>Palmer raised his ruined hand to shield his ruined eye and peered up into the sky.  The planes were now in a tight holding pattern, and as he watched a third joined the two already above.  They had definitely seen him, but weren't shooting - in fact, didn't look armed - and so Palmer turned his attention back to the Maze.</p>
<p>The hedges were as they'd always been; out here on the boundary they were soft sky pencil holly bushes, and as they stretched back they became more prickly and harsh.  They looked as they always had: like hedges.</p>
<p>He sat on the ground and considered for a while.  The planes passed lazily overhead.</p>
<p>"The Maze grows faster if I am inside."</p>
<p>"It started growing when I was shot at.</p>
<p>"It gave me Jimjim.  It gave Morris his ex-wife.  It gave Trudy..."  He didn't know what it had given Trudy if what Rogers had said was true.  "It gave us them in the middle of the Maze."</p>
<p>TODO - finish this thought</p>
<p>He shrugged.  Nothing was going to happen out here.  He turned and strode into the Maze, letting its green spokes rip outwards behind him.  The planes continued to circle against the clear blue sky.  The avenues between the hedgerows were wide here, and so he got back into the Jeep and started driving.  Eventually they narrowed and he carried on on foot, carrying a small pack of the remaining supplies in the waterproof pack on his back, and Jimjim in there as well.</p>
<p>He reached the inner edge of the spokes, offset slightly from the main body of the Maze.  The sky pencils are replaced with close-set squares of Green Berberis, the gaps between them too narrow comfortably to fit a person between, and small spiny tendrils ran between the close-set squares.  He turned right, heading North, back in the direction of distant Grey Base.</p>
<p>After half an hour of walking he stopped to consider his options.  The Sun was almost overhead, but with the sky pencils on his right the light was not too bright.  Previously the Maze had shown itself capable of changing its internal shape, and regardless these Green Berberis were far outside the boundary he had originally seen when he had first arrived.  There was no guarantee that Grey Base was now near the entrance to the Maze.  A better option would be simply to walk down the narrow corridors, trusting his Army clothing to protect him from the worst, and putting up with those spines that got through.  He turned to face inwards and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>The corridors visibly narrowed in front of him.  The gap between the ranks was now perhaps eighteen inches.</p>
<p>This was still a good idea.</p>
<p>They narrowed to sixteen inches.</p>
<p>...Perhaps?  Palmer shifted uneasily and scratched at his ruined eye.</p>
<p>They widened back to seventeen inches.</p>
<p>He shook his head and stepped forwards.  He could worry about this on the way.  The spines began to scratch at the tough fabric of his fatigues.</p>
<p>Fifteen inches.</p>
