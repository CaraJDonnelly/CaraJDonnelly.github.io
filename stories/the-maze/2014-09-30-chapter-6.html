He woke, strapped to the bed in a white room that stank of bleach.  Jimjim was nestled against his left side.  His left eye burned, as did his right hand; together they felt swollen, like two sick balloons.  He slipped in and out of consciousness, and finally awoke to find an excited looking man with a fuzzy beard waving a bag of bullets at him.</p>
<p>"Fantastic!"  The man cried.  "You've taught us so much."</p>
<p>"Careful, Captain Lightwing," said Dr. Schmidt, "it's likely he doesn't understand higher concepts, given that he walked into a hail of bullets."</p>
<p>"Where am I?"  Palmer asked.  Dr. Schmidt made a note on his clipboard.</p>
<p>"Captain Lightwing studies materials to find out why they are strong.  He'd like to ask you some questions about the Maze.  Do you understand what I mean by materials?"</p>
<p>"Of course," said Palmer, his head groggy from the painkillers, poor sleep and the trauma his body had suffered.  "I'm an engineer."</p>
<p>Captain Lightwing threw a surprised look at Dr. Schmidt, who silently shook his head and made a note on his clipboard.</p>
<p>"Delusions," he said.</p>
<p>"I /am/ an engineer," said Palmer, forcefully.</p>
<p>"Violent delusions," said Dr. Schmidt, making a note on his clipboard again.</p>
<p>"How bad is my eye?"</p>
<p>"Please, try to focus."</p>
<p>Palmer frowned.  "I don't find that very funny."</p>
<p>Dr. Schmidt made another note on his clipboard.  Captain Lightwing's mouth was by this point hanging open slightly, and he was staring at Dr. Schmidt with a look of confusion and dismay.</p>
<p>"I am the doctor," said Dr. Schmidt.  "I am responsible for your care.  Please ask your questions, Captain Lightwing."</p>
<p>The Captain was short and fuzzy, with a beard that looked like a perpetual smile.  He reluctantly obeyed.</p>
<p>"How hard was it for you to remove the disc from the Maze?"</p>
<p>"Very easy.  I experience it as a leaf."</p>
<p>"And the second disc?"</p>
<p>"A twig."</p>
<p>"What happened to your eye?"</p>
<p>"Someone shot it."</p>
<p>"While you were inside the Maze?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"So bullet can penetrate the Maze?"</p>
<p>"I guess so."</p>
<p>"These bullets," he said, waggling the bag at Palmer, "were recovered from near the edge of the Maze by Miss Short.  They each weigh one-thirteenth of a bullet of their design each would normally."</p>
<p>"Sure - there were twelve men shooting at me."</p>
<p>Captain Lightwing bobbed his fuzzy head, then looked up at Schmidt.</p>
<p>"You were right, Schmidt-"</p>
<p>"-Doctor Schmidt-"</p>
<p>"-it's telepathy all right.  The Maze is responding to our expectations."</p>
<p>Dr Schmidt nodded, then gestured at Palmer.  "I'll see that he's brought to the test this afternoon."</p>
<p>He ushered Captain Lightwing out, and did not return.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The world is flat, and the sharp edges cut at Palmer's hands, eyes and gums.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>General Morris sat well back from the testing ground, binoculars in his hands.  Before him, the smooth orange rocks that were his experience of the Maze lay shining like sandstone in the sunlight.  There had not been much rain this autumn.</p>
<p>The Maze was apparently telepathic, and if the USAF could reverse engineer how it worked they could teep the Commies and crush them once and for all.  No-one's thoughts would be safe from the mighty US military.</p>
<p>He took another swig from his hip flask and pretended to himself that it was full of water.  No-one else was authorised to watch this experiment without participating; he sat alone.</p>
<p>The Maze responded to expectations.  To observations.  Down below at the bottom of the gentle incline stood the members of the test protocol:  Schmidt, Palmer, Miss Short, and the blindfolded volunteer.</p>
<p>Dr Schmidt handed the volunteer a two way radio, and unfolded a bright blue deck chair.  He sat upon it, his back firmly to the edifice that dominated the landscape.  He clicked his fingers at Trudy, who started trudging her way inwards and soon stepped under the bright orange archway, passing almost out of General Morris' viewfinders.</p>
<p>Dr Schmidt clicked his fingers again, and Palmer positioned himself in front of him, facing the Maze.</p>
<p>The four of them now stood in a line: Palmer facing inwards, Dr Schmidt seated and facing outwards, the volunteer behind him facing inwards but blindfolded, and Trudy, standing within the Maze and facing outwards.  General Morris was happily too important to be put so close to any experimental endeavour.  He took another belt of Scotch, and slumped down to watch.</p>
<p>---<br />
TODO - earlier than this, something from Byrne's perspective.<br />
---</p>
<p>Amon Byrne stood blindfolded, aware that the Maze was some distance in front of him, but not certain how far.  The two-way radio in his hands clicked on, and he heard the psychiatrist Dr. Schmidt both from its speaker and from directly behind him.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Trudy Short stood within the Maze boundary, keeping her gaze fixed solely on the blindfolded soldier some 150 yards ahead of her.  Her arm burned from her self-inflicted wounds, and the Sun was unpleasantly bright, but her eyes saw nothing but the men in front of her.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Palmer Jones swayed, groggy, his head full of painkillers and his cut hand and ruined eye both full of pain.  Before him, Dr. Schmidt sat, a stopwatch and voice recorder in his hands, as well as the two-way radio in his lap.</p>
<p>"Experiment One ready," repeated Dr. Schmidt.  "Experiment One begins."  He started the stop-watch and raised the two-way radio to his lips.  "Please begin walking forwards, ten paces, in a straight line at a steady pace, Subject One."</p>
<p>Byrne started to walk forwards.  Trudy was staring at him, her eyes wide.  Byrne's feet led him down the straight track into the Maze that Palmer had had to dig, running straight up to Trudy.  If they had used mechanical diggers, or even any unaffected people to dig the trench the Byrne might have been alerted to the position of the Maze boundary by the slight change in texture beneath his feet.</p>
<p>"Stop," commanded Dr. Schmidt over the two-way radio.  "Turn around and return."</p>
<p>Byrne stopped, turned around and paced back to them.  He stopped almost exactly where he had begun - his military precision showing in the counting and size of his paces.</p>
<p>Dr. Schmidt gestured at Palmer impatiently.</p>
<p>"Successful return, doctor."</p>
<p>Dr. Schmidt wrote down the time.  "Experiment Two. Experiment Two ready.  Experiment Two begins. Turn around and repeat with twenty paces."</p>
<p>Byrne complied.  The edge of the Maze was one hundred and twenty yards away from his starting point, but the theory was that if he was not directly aware of the boundary (and neither were any other observers) then his expectations should allow him to penetrate unimpeded.</p>
<p>Experiment Two, at twenty paces, was naturally a success, as were experiments Three and Four at forty and eighty paces respectively.  Byrne had been told that there would be six tests.</p>
<p>Experiment Five began.  Byrne set out as before, and walked at a steady pace towards the Maze boundary.  Dr. Schmidt, watching his stopwatch, had been estimating his Subject's speed, and had worked out precisely when he should come up against the wall.</p>
<p>Trudy saw Byrne take the pivotal step.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Palmer breathed out.  Byrne had continued his slow pace inwards, now fully contained within the Maze.  Dr Schmidt was staring up at Palmer's face with a look of smug satisfaction.  The two-way radio deactivated, he spoke.  "Report, Palmer."</p>
<p>"He's inside.  He's paced it out and turned around.  No sign of slowing down, or any sign he knows he's within the Maze."</p>
<p>Dr. Schmidt glowed, and glanced at his stopwatch.  "Twenty paces to go?"</p>
<p>The Maze boundary was more like twenty-five paces outwards of Byrne's position, but Palmer simply said "Yes."</p>
<p>Immediately Dr. Schmidt glowed with pleasure, raised the two-way radio to his lips, and gave an instruction.</p>
<p>"Subject, you may remove your blindfold."  He clicked off the two-way.</p>
<p>"No!" Palmer cried.</p>
<p>What it was that the three of them - Palmer, Trudy and Morris - saw was later found to be broadly consistent.  Byrne stood stock still as though frozen, the blindfold barely moved an inch from his eyes.  Then he puffed up to six times his original size and collapsed onto the ground as though made of sponge.  He was very definitely dead.</p>
<p>"You bastard," swore Palmer, reaching his hands out to grasp Dr. Schmidt's bulging neck.  "I'll kill you, you bastard."</p>
<p>"Careful, Mr. Jones," Schmidt surged to his feet, forcing Palmer to take a step back by sheer dint of his bulk.  He deliberately glanced behind him, and spoke into the voice recorder.  "Experiment Five: I do not see the Subject, and assume that he is within the Maze boundary, presumably incapacitated.  I was misled by my acting assistant Palmer Jones, who reported inaccurately that the Subject was twenty yards behind me and therefore safely outside of the object."  Schmidt gestured at Palmer.  "Do you understand that you have killed a human being through your negligence?  Worse, an American?"</p>
<p>"/I/ killed-"</p>
<p>"You reported to me that there were twenty yards left for the Subject to traverse."  Dr Schmidt smiled a glassy and unpleasant smile.  "Is that not so?"</p>
<p>"No - and it's on the tape.  Why would anyone-" but Dr. Schmidt had clicked the recording device off.</p>
<p>"I remind you who is holding the tape."  Dr. Schmidt shook his head sorrowfully.  "People like you - the mentally deficient - do have their uses, but are sadly very unreliable."</p>
<p>Palmer's head clouded over.  He was pumped full of drugs, was badly injured, and a man he had liked was now dead - and a doctor was saying that it was his fault.  Confused, he only heard Dr. Schmidt's question aver several repetitions.</p>
<p>"What has happened to the Subject's body?"</p>
<p>"He's... swollen up."</p>
<p>"Go and retrieve it."</p>
<p>Time clicked, and Palmer was standing next to the Subject's body, reaching down.  "His name was Byrne," he said quietly, and straightened up again.</p>
<p>Click, and Palmer was deep inside the Maze, Trudy holding his hand.  Click.  Palmer was outside a small concrete pillbox, alone.</p>
<p>"Come on," said Trudy, coming back outside.  She took him by the hand again (which /hurt/) and led him through the door.  "We'll be safe in here."</p>
<p>Click.  The press of flesh against flesh - he moved his left hand in a gentle stroking motion down Trudy's back.  "No," she said, "sleep."</p>
<p>Click. Palmer was -</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>- he was Byrne screaming as he grew and grew, his skin ripping as his flesh became engorged.</p>
