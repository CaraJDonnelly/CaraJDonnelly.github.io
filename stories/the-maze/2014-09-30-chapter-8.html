TODO: Cold war timeline<br />

<p>When he woke she was gone again, and the hail had stopped.  He stepped out and started to head towards the main entrance.  After all, if she was outside, and she knew the schedule of bombardments as she had seemed to, it must be safe.  He struck on as best as he could, not used to walking with only one eye with which to see.</p>
<p>The holly leaves were scratching both sides of his shoulders, now, and he could not find the way out.  After what felt like an hour, he finally arrived at the ditch, and painfully clambered over it, one-handed.</p>
<p>The holly bushes were getting slightly further apart as he travelled outwards, and he lengthened his stride somewhat.</p>
<p>There came a /whiff/ as the first bullet tore through the hedges just to his right.</p>
<p>He stood stock-still for a long, dangerous moment.  He could here choose death, become the second person to die within the Maze.  Perhaps that would remove a Curse, Trudy's Curse or Morris' Curse.  It would be easier, here, to lay down and let the darkness come.</p>
<p>He turned and hurried back.  Choosing to let life slip from your hands through apathy was not a choice one could accept, when facing it fully.</p>
<p>The path back inwards was harder than it had been coming out, seeming to narrow much more sharply than it had widened.  He adopted a sideways shambling gait, his ruined hand held up in front of him and his neck twisted to one side, keeping his ruined eye high away from the whipping branches.  Even so he was clawed from both sides by the leaves, the fresh clothes Trudy had bargained for him rent and torn after less than a day's use.</p>
<p>The ditch came.  He threw himself down and the bullets started in earnest, flying overhead.  He lay in the cold mud and snow for a while, letting it soothe his cuts.  Eventually, he crawled around the length of the circular ditch, checking for Trudy.  She wasn't there, and he hoped she was alright.  The hedges creaked.  Maybe it was better that she couldn't see him like this - bleeding, in ruined clothes, with a crippled hand and eye.  A wave of shame crashed over him.</p>
<p>He shoved the feeling away, fiercely.  What point was there in being ashamed while sitting alone?  Why ought /he/ be ashamed when at this moment bullets were flying over his head, shot by men who couldn't see any of the beauty in front of them?  Why should /he/ be ashamed when he had thought first of another person's safety and second of his own social needs?  Out, shame!</p>
<p>The hedges creaked again and, turning his face upwards, he beheld them growing in front of him, faster than they had ever grown before.  Beneath his hands on the ditch wall he felt a writhing as of snakes, the roots of the hedges thickening and rearranging and plunging further into the depths of the soil.</p>
<p>The sound of bullets had been steadily receding, either as the Maze had become more difficult to penetrate or as the soldiers responded to its growth by retreating.  Either way, it had again become safe to come out of the ditch and - it seemed - unwise to stay in the Maze longer than was strictly necessary.</p>
<p>"One death caused all this," Palmer muttered to himself.</p>
<p>The corridors had narrowed now to be almost impassable.  Palmer was stepping crabwise and still the sharp leaves were scratching at his front and back.</p>
<p>It occurred to him that there was not any guarantee that there even was a way out any more.  Perhaps the Maze had chosen to keep him?  He pushed forward, refusing to give up hope, and as though sensing his desperation the leaves visibly thickened and drew closer.</p>
<p>The way out was no longer where the way in had been.  The maze of twisty passages were all green and luscious, and only his often-blocked view of the Sun gave him an idea of time or direction.  Eventually he reached the blackened soil the HazMat team had scorched and sterilised, and the spent bullet casings of the USAF's attack upon him.</p>
<p>The Maze path widened out into a small clearing here, but continued on well past the slope of the valley where it had ended on the day of Dr. Schmidt's experiment.  Palmer sat, tired, no longer worried about faraway bullets, and traced his fingers sadly through the dead earth.</p>
<p>---<br />
TODO what does he think of, here?<br />
---</p>
<p>Eventually he stood again, and made his way outwards.  The ways were widening again here, and this time Palmer got the sense that this wasn't like the strange changes in the Maze's inner geometry he had seen further in, but just a genuine widening of the way.</p>
<p>He reached the edge of the Maze proper to find a circle of on-off hedges, arranged in a long line - no, a long arc forming a circle, although by this point the curvature of the Maze was so small that the boundary appeared flat at first glance.  How far had he walked?  In twisted lines, never knowing the way (yet never thinking of himself as 'lost') for maybe six hours.  This was far faster than it had previously been spreading.</p>
<p>The leaves were still moving outwards, visibly bursting up from the ground as buds that grew about six inches every ten seconds, like a slow upwards waterfall of green.  He stepped around to get a closer look, and it stopped.</p>
<p>He bent down anyway, and ran his fingers through the young leaves.  Each of them was as soft as a lamb's ear, but now, he realised, even the outer edge of the Maze appeared to him as holly bush.</p>
<p>He pulled his hand through the soft leaves and started to walk back into the Maze.  Immediately his hand was stuck fast, the hedge resuming its growth and flowing smoothly up over his arm.  The spines on the leaves hardened and cut at him, and he leaped out of the Maze in fear, arresting its growth - his left hand was his only good hand, now, and he had no desire to damage it.  Ever-so-carefully working at the branches he worked himself free with only minor scratches.</p>
<p>He hopped in to the Maze boundary, then hopped out again.  He did this several more times.  Whenever he was inside the Maze grew merrily, and whenever he was outside it paused.  There was much he needed to report.</p>
<p>----<br />
TODO: This should probably not be a farmhouse.</p>
<p>The outpost had retreated so far it took him an hour of walking for it to even appear on the horizon.  Long before he reached it he came to a farmhouse, newly abandoned, and filled his belly from their larder; the doors had been left unlocked.  Since the days had been tiring of late he took himself upstairs, hauling his weight up the stair rail with his one good hand, and fell asleep in the master bedroom, his grubby hands resting easily on the clean white sheets, his oily hair sunk deeply into the soft feather pillows.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>The cliffs rose above him so he wove a rope from the grass that he had grown.  He climbed, his eyes clear, his hands strong, and a broad grin on his face.</p>
<p>----<br />
TODO: Before this point we need some discussion about the Curses.  And stop calling them Curses in the text.<br />

General Morris was drunk, Schmidt observed keenly - the first time he'd been drunk on duty, but drunk nonetheless.  Schmidt coughed, gently, and the General flinched, waking.</p>
<p>"General Morris," he said, suavely.  "I am afraid I must report insubordination in the ranks."</p>
<p>The General simply sat, more hunched and toad-like than ever, and clutched at the small plastic statuette that Dr. Schmidt had observed him grow progressively more attached to over the course of his service here.  Naturally, the reason for this attachment was classified and therefore unavailable to Dr. Schmidt, but it was clearly unhealthy.  He looked disapprovingly around the cluttered office.</p>
<p>He mused silently for a moment.  What was it about those of his patients in this base that were mentally weak enough to be deluded by the alien object that caused them to fixate on such pathetic objects?  Morris with his golfing statuette, Palmer with his ridiculous teddy bear (although no mystery /there/), and Trudy with -</p>
<p>"Russians," muttered General Morris.  "If they find out we're under attack by aliens, freaks from outer space, and we're losing, they'll nuke us.  They'll have to."</p>
<p>Dr Schmidt had a long experience of dealing with paranoid ideations: never contradict, always damp the fire.</p>
<p>"No evidence that they've found out yet, I hope," he said, smoothly.</p>
<p>"It's getting somewhat hard to hide, Schmidt."</p>
<p>"Doctor Schmidt, please, General Morris."</p>
<p>"Fuck you."  The General's eye's suddenly filled with tears and he clutched again at his plastic statuette.  "She left me, Schmidt, for golf.  For golf!  She left me for golf!"</p>
<p>"Yes," Dr Schmidt began, "we've spoken -"</p>
<p>"Do you know what she said to me when she walked out?"  The General said, crying, "'At least *I* know where my balls are.'  She said that!"  His tears redoubled.  "To my fuh-fuh-"</p>
<p>Dr Schmidt carefully maintained his profession demeanour and let none of his annoyance show.  He let the General cry for ten more seconds, counting silently, then picked up the iron paperweight from the centre of the General's desk and slammed it down with as much force as he could muster.</p>
<p>General Morris looked up, terrified.  Had his psychiatrist gone mad?</p>
<p>"There is insubordination in the ranks," ground out Dr Schmidt.  "Deal with the insubordination."</p>
<p>"Insubordination?" asked the General, not having been listening previously.  Dr Schmidt leaned in, his cheeks burning a dark and dangerous red.</p>
<p>"Tables," he hissed.</p>
<p>The General sat there and realised he was quite possibly about to die, his skull caved in by a mad doctor.  Schmidt's hand was still resting on the iron paperweight.</p>
<p>Dr Schmidt hissed again.  "Tables."  He exhaled noisily through his nose.  "Someone is voting for tables!"</p>
<p>"Schmidt, -"</p>
<p>"Doctor Schmidt!"</p>
<p>"I have no idea what you are talking about."  The General put the statuette back on his desk as casually as he could.</p>
<p>"My /morale/ experiment.  Someone in the ranks has started noting down that they enjoyed the meal whenever there were more than twenty tables.  Then more than thirty tables.  Then forty.  The machine was set up to value positive feedback over negative and so now tonight the machine has put out an order for no tents, no food and /five hundred/ tables."</p>
<p>Schmidt turned and started to pace up and down, stress causing a tic that flickered his bulbous eyes. "The experiment - years of research - tens of thousands of dollars - wasted!  Ruined!"  He turned and shoved his face into that of General Morris, his eyes popped alarmingly and his breath so minty fresh that it stung the General's nose.  "By a /traitor/."</p>
<p>The General lumbered to his feet, and used the intercom to call for Colonel Blake.  Some minutes passed before he arrived.</p>
<p>"Colonel," spat the General, "take a complement of men and smash the morale computer."</p>
<p>Colonel Blake saluted and turned to go, then rushed forwards to restrain Dr Schmidt, who had uttered a desolate cry and grasped the iron paperweight, plainly intending to apply it to the General's forehead.</p>
<p>"Colonel Blake, show the good doctor to a holding cell, and release him when he has cooled off."  The General paused.  "Then smash the machine."</p>
<p>Colonel Blake managed to transfer the coherently shouting Dr Schmidt to one hand for long enough for him to salute the General, then bundled him roughly out of the door.  No-one, not even Blake, had any love for Dr Schmidt.</p>
<p>The General sat, his hands trembling slightly, and his eyes slid over the cheap plastic statuette that was his Curse.  He picked it up, surprised.  Had the lumpen figure on it always been completing a back swing?  Surely before it had been putting, bent over.  His mind clouded over as he remembered his ex-wife and the life of solitude ahead of him.  He shuddered and shook his head.  No.  That would not be.</p>
<p>----<br />
/The lesser mountains fell below him, the greater mountains stood before him.  He -/<br />
----<br />
Palmer woke feeling awful.  He stumbled to the kitchen to get some water.  The taps were cut off, but there was a carton of tomato juice in the pantry which quenched his thirst.</p>
<p>He could not wash, but the wardrobe upstairs had clean and well-kept clothes.  He struggled to put them on one-handed, but he managed.</p>
<p>It was just growing light outside, the Sun shining clear through the crisp winter air.</p>
<p>He set off.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Trudy sat, and stared at nothing.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Dr. Schmidt strode to the medical compound, humming a cheery tune.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Colonel Blake regarded the dead body of General Morris, and felt neither sadness nor surprise.<br />
TODO: Make it clear that Blake has killed Morris.  Give Blake a reason to snap.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The wind danced over the surface of the Maze, and it told no-one what it felt beneath its feet.</p>
