<p>Chapter 11</p>
<p>----<br />
TODO: Cold war timeline<br />
----</p>
<p>TODO - I like the idea of the base being recreated each time.  Put that idea much earlier.</p>
<p>Night had fallen, and Rogers stood quietly in the selfsame alleyway Trudy had used to frequent whilst cutting herself, the layout of the base being recreated with military precision each time they retreated from the Maze.  No-one came here after hours, and no-one was present to see Roger's terrible grimace.</p>
<p>His apple-red cheeks were flushed with hatred and alcohol, and the gentlest of breezes set him swaying back and forth as though ready to fall.</p>
<p>It was time.  He rushed forwards in halting steps to the brink of the end of the alley, stopped short and leaned out to spy round the corner.  There was no-one there.  He stepped out and muttered to the empty space.</p>
<p>"Kill him."  He rushed again to the door of the medical centre.  "Get him alone and kill him."</p>
<p>He turned and ran back to the alleyway, returning with a can of gasoline.  He thoroughly soaked the entrance way and proceeded inside.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Palmer woke, his mouth full of blood.  Rogers was standing over him, and the room stank of gasoline.  Palmer willed himself to relax; if this was to be it, then so be it.  Instead Rogers leaned down and begin undoing the straps that held him to the medical bed.</p>
<p>"Bastard's not here," he muttered, more to himself than to Palmer.  "Bastard's not here to burn."</p>
<p>Palmer's arms were now free, and he tried to help Rogers by working open the strap holding down his chest.  His one remaining good hand was weak and his fingers numb from lack of blood; he achieved nothing.</p>
<p>"I heard what he did to Byrne," continued Rogers.  "When I was guarding you and he was updating his damn audio diaries.  Bastard."</p>
<p>TODO: Palmer to get the dentures.  More agency.</p>
<p>Palmer was now free, and Rogers dragged him to his feet.  Blood was oozing from Palmer's mouth and he couldn't stand without support; Rogers pressed something into his good hand, a strange shape that turned out to be rubber dentures.  He worked them into his mouth as best he could, and the two of them proceeded out into the night.  Rogers turned, struck a match and led him to waiting jeep, moving as only a living animal or a drunk human can.  He vanished back to the doorway once more to light a fuse, then started the Jeep and slowly drove it into the night.</p>
<p>Palmer retched and Rogers passed him some opiate pills.  They drove on in silence.</p>
<p>"You really an alien?" Demanded Rogers eventually.  Palmer shook his head, not trusting himself to speak.</p>
<p>They reached the carpool unseen and Rogers helped Palmer into an empty guard caravan.  The room was around six foot by twelve, with narrow desks running around three of the walls, and several cheap office chairs.  Rogers opened a drawer in one of the desks and took out a bottle of Haig Scotch.</p>
<p>"Where is everybody?" croaked Palmer.  He sat in one of the chairs, heavily, and Rogers took the other.</p>
<p>"I set the Maze wall on fire with napalm," explained Rogers.  "Everyone's out there expecting an invasion."</p>
<p>He passed Palmer a full tumbler of Scotch, and belched.  Palmer could only put a hand over his face in exhaustion.  Rogers was so much older than he had been a few days ago.  So much... less young.  He took a belt of the warm Scotch, and breathed out.  It felt good to breathe so easily, and to sit opposite a friend.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes some time later and took another swig.  Rogers was sitting staring into the middle distance, and it seemed like tomorrow could take care of itself, for at least an hour or two.</p>
<p>"Thank you," he said, his voice unrecognisable -- all cracking and low.<br />
Rogers barely nodded.  His cheeks that had been red from alcohol and then cold had begun to pale, and his weariness was a physical presence in the room.  Palmer waited for a long minute, listening to the silence, then leaned over and shook Rogers' knee.</p>
<p>"Where do we sleep?"</p>
<p>Rogers silently pointed to a small room off the side.  Palmer worked his way to his feet, found a latrine and drank several tumblers of water, and fell asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>DREAM: The egg existed, and it cracked.  Out jumped people with long spoons for hands.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Rogers was slumped where he had left him.  Palmer drank another glass of water, then wet a towel and wiped Rogers' mouth.  His skin was hot to touch, and the top of his uniform showed traces of drool.</p>
<p>"Drink," croaked Palmer, pressing a cup to his lips.  Rogers drank.</p>
<p>"Need to move."  It was not yet dawn outside, but the sky had brightened from a pitch dark to a navy blue.  They had slept for perhaps four hours.  The fires in the night had provided a distraction but soon reinforcements from outside would arrive and the base would become inescapeable.</p>
<p>He eventually poured water over Rogers, and poured more straight into his mouth.  Rogers began choking and swallowed convulsively.  Palmer passed him six tabs of opiates and another full tumbler of water.  He swallowed them all and made to fall asleep again.</p>
<p>"Wake up," said Palmer.  "They'll kill us if they find us.  They think I'm an allien, and you set fire to the base."</p>
<p>Rogers opened his eyes a crack.  "Go on without me."</p>
<p>"I'm not leaving you here to die.  Hurry up, it hurts to talk."</p>
<p>Rogers got to his feet slowly.  "Let's shut up and go, then."</p>
<p>Palmer snorted, then began to laugh in earnest, a dry, painful laugh.  He was a recently demoted Brigadier General that had been declared a mentally retarded alien bent on invading Earth.  "I've got midterms next week," he managed to choke out.  "Gonna be an engineer someday."  Tears of laughter began to roll down his face.  Ruined eyes could still cry, he noted.</p>
<p>Eventually he came back to himself.  Rogers was holding him upright and hugging him gently.</p>
<p>"Come on," said Rogers.</p>
<p>They boarded the Jeep and drove South in silence, quickly leaving Grey Base behind in the early morning air.  The sky lightened until it was impossibly bright and clear, and Palmer had to tilt his head to face the Maze.  Its growth had slowed with Palmer outside of its boundaries, but its sheer scale was now oppressive.</p>
<p>The Jeep followed a well-maintained asphalt road until it passed under the Maze boundary.  Rogers swung left and continued over the cornfields.</p>
<p>"Guess that's far enough," he said, a few hours later.  They turned South-East, heading directly away from the Maze.</p>
<p>"You not going back?" asked Palmer.  Rogers grunted.</p>
<p>"To hell with all of them, and that /thing/," he said.  "Let 'em nuke it."</p>
<p>He said this with such venom that Palmer asked "Nuke it?"</p>
<p>Rogers nodded.  "You scared the hell out of everyone by calling it an egg.  Schmidt was screaming that they had to nuke it, nuke it now."</p>
<p>"Soviets won't like it," muttered Palmer, sleepily.  Rogers said something he couldn't make out and he slept again.</p>
<p>---<br />
DREAM: But keep this one even if you can the rest.</p>
<p>The Maze sent its roots into New York City, crushing buildings and tearing up the streets.</p>
<p>Palmer Jones stood, watching, and decided it should stop.</p>
<p>It stopped.</p>
<p>"Where am I?" asked Trudy, and she looked straight at Palmer, and he looked straight at her.</p>
<p>"What happened to your eyes?" he asked.  She shook her head impatiently and strode on-</p>
<p>-towards the pillbox, now in Central Park.</p>
<p>"What happened to your eyes?" he repeated.  They had been terrible, so dark he had to stifle a cry of primal fear as she again turned them upon him.</p>
<p>"Nothing," she bit off.  "Where am I?"</p>
<p>"My dream," he replied.  She looked angrier.</p>
<p>New York lit up like the Sun on the sea and everything went white.  When the world came back, Trudy had been incinerated, leaving only her silhouette on the concrete.</p>
<p>"Come back," he said, addressing the silhouette.</p>
<p>"Go away.  I'm dead."</p>
<p>"Please?"</p>
<p>"No.  Try harder."</p>
<p>He walked off and found General Morris shivering on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>"Now, you /are/ dead."</p>
<p>"I'm not," General Morris said.  "I've just got a fever.  That's why I survived the bomb.  You, too."</p>
<p>Palmer wandered on through a city where only the feverish survived.</p>
