TODO: Show the fucking funeral!  That sounds like an awesome scene!</p>
<p>Palmer drank the last of the tomato juice and threw the carton away.  The outpost was now some half-mile ahead of him; he supposed they had been spooked by the rapid expansion the Maze had shown after Byrne's death.</p>
<p>He walked up and was struck by the base's silence.  No guards stood at the inner checkpoint, and nor did anyone walk from caravan to caravan.  The air was thick with in tension.</p>
<p>A volley of shots rang out in unison, just once.  The feeling of tension eased, and immediately the sounds of life began again: doors quietly opening, people making plans, food being prepared.</p>
<p>Palmer strode in on his aching feet towards the source of the shots.  Soon he reached a large square area, unmarked by any walls or fences except that provided by the loose scattering of nearby buildings - and filled with overweight officers straightening their uniforms and slowly preparing to hurry away.</p>
<p>Dr. Schmidt was standing right in front of him.</p>

<p>The Maze rustled, if observed by the right kind of person.</p>
<p>A memory of a thing is not the thing itself.  Places can be described, painted, even evoked, but the indefinable thing of experience, the qualia, are ever new and fresh.  Down below, running water, covered in hard rock and soft earth.  Above, the winds blowing with different strengths even over the relatively small area and range of heights the Maze covered.</p>
<p>We do not percieve people directly; our brain applies its usual pattern recognition and tags the resulting person with the corresponding identity we carry around in our heads.  In dreams the pattern recognition is not necessary, and our interal images have those tags applied directly, or perhaps are even the identities themselves made not flesh but real nontheless.  These tags can get dislodged, leaving people unable to recognise their closest loved ones.</p>
