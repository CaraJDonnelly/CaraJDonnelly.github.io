May 11th, 1950: Robert Schuman sets out a plan for a united European police force.<br />
----</p>
<p>The light was pale and the air was cold.  The autumn had started and the fields that they walked through were bare except for stubble, the harvest having finished.  The atmosphere was that of a train station after finding one's platform but before one's train has left: one of a journey frustrated by the constraints of Time.</p>
<p>"Big fence," commented Palmer. "To get in here we had to pass some guards and checkpoints, but we've not come to the other side."</p>
<p>"We're going to the centre of the fence - the thing it's surrounding."  Trudy was staring down at her feet as they walked.</p>
<p>"Are we allowed?  Should we wait for the General to, I don't know, induct me or something?"</p>
<p>"It's why we're here.  You should know why you're here."</p>
<p>Ahead, Palmer could just make out what seemed to be a copse of trees.  Trudy was watching him silently, and her shoulders slumped as she did.</p>
<p>The copse of trees resolved itself into a jumble of topiary, which in turn resolved itself into a large series of hedges surrounded by a wide cordon manned by armed guards.  Trudy walked up to the cordon and began speaking to the captain there.  They eventually were waved through.</p>
<p>Palmer rubbed his hands against his trousers, realising that he had no idea what was going on.  "Is this dangerous?"</p>
<p>Trudy gave him an inscrutable look.  "No," she replied.</p>
<p>The path led directly to a large gap in the hedges.  It ran on for about sixty feet, then took a sharp left and disappeared.</p>
<p>"It's a hedge maze," Palmer said. "An old-style maze, right?"</p>
<p>"Personally," Trudy replied, " I think it's all a sick joke."</p>
<p>They walked in, Trudy falling slightly behind him as they did so,</p>
<p>The maze was cool, but not unpleasant - the hedge walls rising on either side blocked the autumn breezes.  Trudy shivered slightly, and drew closer to Palmer, stepping in time with him.  He moved over, giving her more room in the passageway.</p>
<p>"How big is this place?"</p>
<p>"Hedges grow," said Trudy.  "But should take us about three hours to get to the centre.  That's the point of thing."</p>
<p>Palmer frowned.  "We'll be in here for six hours?  Have you had breakfast?"</p>
<p>Trudy shrugged.  "There's water in my pack."</p>
<p>They walked.</p>
<p>"If you led, we'd get there faster."</p>
<p>Trudy shook her head, staring blankly at the side of the passageway.  Palmer, not used to women, felt helpless, and examined the floor.  In the corner of his vision there were her beautiful, shapely breasts, still covered by only a thin sweater.  He eventually answered himself.</p>
<p>"Guess it wouldn't be much of a maze if someone who knew the way was leading."</p>
<p>The maze had few true dead ends, appearing to be constructed of several concentric mazes, with only one path through to the next maze inwards; an unhelpful pathway was more likely to link back up to the outer circle than simply stop.  Of course, there were exceptions, but that just added to the challenge of exploring.</p>
<p>"Good maze," said Palmer, approvingly.  Trudy threw him another odd look, then spoke.</p>
<p>"Good?" She asked. "You genuinely like it here?"</p>
<p>"Sure," he said.  "There's no wind, there's grass under our feet, the bushes smell nice.  Oh."</p>
<p>They had come to another one of the concentric circles which demarcated each successive maze.  This circle contained a deep ditch which ran all the way around and straight up to the outer edge of the next inner maze; to search each way in to the inner maze they would have to jump inwards, search and - if they find themselves outside again - jump outwards before proceeding to the next point of ingress.  The ditch looked... wrong.</p>
<p>"They tried to burn it out," Trudy said, by way of explanation.  "Back when it was this size.  They dug a trench all around it and filled it with napalm for twelve hours."</p>
<p>Palmer leaped inwards, onto bare dead earth.  "It didn't burn?"</p>
<p>Trudy shrugged.  "Guess not."  She followed him.</p>
<p>Palmer examined the hedge on his right more closely.  The sun had risen higher in the sky and it was holly bush here, the leaves dark green, hard and waxy; further out it had been leylandii, and on the outer edges it had been privet.  He plucked and crushed a leaf, and spiked his finger in doing so.</p>
<p>"Smells normal."  He offered it to Trudy, and she leaned forwards to sniff it in his hand.  As she leaned forwards her perfect breasts swung out from her body, and Palmer nervously rubbed the sweat from his right hand off against the back of his trousers. "I used to live in New Jersey, before the Commies poisoned the groundwater."  Trudy nodded.</p>
<p>They walked on, Palmer very conscious of his body, and his elbows rubbing against the spines of the holly bush on the left, and the soft warm fabric of Trudy's sweater on the right.  The topmost leaves rustled above their heads, and just as the path seemed to be turning inwards to what must be the next circle - they hit another dead end.</p>
<p>Trudy stopped half a step in front of him, and looked backwards at him, irritated.  The hedge in front of them was thinner than usual, and Palmer could just make out the next circle on the inside.</p>
<p>"It's a dead end," he said, "we should go back."</p>
<p>"Are you serious?  It's right, and I mean right, there.  You want to go all the way back to the ditch and waste time?"</p>
<p>"I can see it's there, but this isn't a path through.  We should go back and find the right path."  Palmer felt this required some justification.  "Because it's a maze."  Perfect.</p>
<p>"We've been walking in circles for three hours," said Trudy, flatly.  She hadn't moved from where she had stopped.</p>
<p>"Hey - this is only the first path from the ditch we've explored, and it's got us right up to the next circle.  That means the other paths have to be fairly direct, and they won't take long."  Palmer turned to go back towards the ditch.</p>
<p>"You're seriously going to go back to the ditch."  Her voice was flat and angry.  "What if there's no way through in the other paths?"</p>
<p>Palmer rubbed his hand against his forehead, and frowned.  "Of course there'll be a path.  There's always a path - it's a maze."</p>
<p>"But the centre is /that/ way," said Trudy, pointing.</p>
<p>"The holly bushes are in the way," Palmer said. "It'd hurt."</p>
<p>"So you're never going to do anything in your life because it would hurt?  You're always going to go back and look for the easier way through even when it screws you over?"</p>
<p>Palmer shrugged, helplessly.  "I guess."  He moved to go.</p>
<p>Trudy straightened up and spoke to his back.  "There's no other way through."  Palmer looked back, surprised.  "The... hedges grow, and this is the way that's supposed to be clear.  This is the way you have to go."  She folded her arms over her breasts.</p>
<p>"Uh."  Palmer shrugged.  She knew the maze.  "OK."</p>
<p>He walked up to the inner edge at the point where the leaves were the lightest green - where the leaves were youngest and therefore softer.  They still looked sharp and dark.  He stepped forwards, his hands pushing out in front of his face.  The spines cut into his soft flesh, drawing blood, and tore at his clothes.  The branches had thorns that scored his newly-bare arms, and shorter branches that he had pushed away from his face whipped through at his eyes.</p>
<p>He had been locked in a dog cage by some older boys at school once, when the National Guard had come around on a recruiting drive.  They'd been well-treated dogs, so the only damage they'd done was to leave him with scars on his legs and belly, plus get him a suspension from school for messing with the dogs.  He hadn't ratted out the older boys, though.  These thorns hurt like the healing dog scratches had.</p>
<p>He was conscious of Trudy staying close behind him, and he flexed his elbows outwards to try to offer her more shelter from the branches.  Staggering outwards onto freshly-cut grass, he sat heavily and rubbed at the blood that had run into his eyes from cuts on his forehead and temples.  Trudy move around in front, looking down at him.  She blasphemed quietly, and sat down next to him.</p>
<p>Eventually he glanced over at her.  At least he had shielded her well - she had escaped pretty much unscathed, as far as he could tell.</p>
<p>"You're pretty hurt," she said.</p>
<p>"Naw."  In fact, his right hand was still bleeding, and the cut looked deep.</p>
<p>"Sorry."  She started to stammer, looking stricken, "S-sorry.  I didn't know it would cut you like that."</p>
<p>"Could I have some water, please?"</p>
<p>"S-sure."  She pulled her rucksack to one side, where he couldn't see it, and pulled out a bottle of water, wiping it off as she did so.  "I've got some bread, too."</p>
<p>Palmer was too tired and hungry to feel anything but grateful.  "Thanks."</p>
<p>"I really didn't think it would be that bad."</p>
<p>"Nor did I," said Palmer, looking up at where he had pushed a gap.  "From this side it looks mostly young leaves, too."</p>
<p>Trudy was silent.  Eventually, having both eaten some bread and drank some water, Palmer stood and looked around.</p>
<p>The next inner circle was empty except for a single carved stone pedestal at the centre; this was the centre of the Maze.  On the far side of the circle was a well cut gap that led outwards into the maze.</p>
<p>"There's a gap right over there."  Palmer said.  "You lied."</p>
<p>Trudy stayed silent.</p>
<p>"We could have come through that way, couldn't we?  Tell me that.  Tell me if you can't see that gap with your own two eyes."</p>
<p>She looked ready to spit venom, but eventually she spoke.  "Yes", she admitted, her blue eyes bitter and full of spite.  "We could have come through there."</p>
<p>"Instead I pushed my way through a fucking /holly bush/ to get here a little quicker."</p>
<p>Trudy got up, and walked onwards to the pedestal.</p>
<p>"Here, come and get it.  It's been waiting for you."</p>
<p>Palmer strode up behind her, still angry.  His anger was deflated, though, when he caught sight of what was on the pedestal.</p>
<p>"Jimjim?"</p>
<p>On the pedestal was a large, fluffy teddy bear, missing one eye and most of its stuffing.  Trudy picked it up.</p>
<p>"Guess this was yours, huh?"</p>
<p>"How did this get here?"  Palmer took it from her with his left hand, and stroked its fur.  "What?  Yes, this was... this was mine. But I lost it when my father died."  He hugged it to himself.  "It was in the car with him."  He looked at it closely; it was the same golden brown fur that was long enough to clump together and almost to curl, giving the impression of what fire would look like if it moved like caramel.  His left ear where Palmer used to chew as a toddler was worn down to the rough white fabric, and his right leg was loose with stuffing was poking through.  He gently pushed it back in, and -</p>
<p>/heard the door to his bedroom open.  It was Mrs Sutton, the social worker, who had told him about Father's death not an hour before.  She came over to sit next to him on the bed, and they sat in silence, his hands twisting and untwisting the worn green blanket that lay over his sheets.  Father was dead, and he understood that, so instead he asked "Did Jimjim survive?"  Too late in her eyes he saw judgement and calculation, and knowing that he had made a mistake he/</p>
<p>- became aware of Trudy's eyes on him.  He tucked Jimjim under one arm firmly, and repeated himself, louder.</p>
<p>"How did this get here?"</p>
<p>"It grew here, like the hedges.  Everyone that finishes the Maze gets something unique to them."</p>
<p>"Everyone gets one?"</p>
<p>"Everyone that can see the Maze and completes it, sure.  They tried taking them away from people, back when this first started.  But it just kept coming back to them no matter what they tried, and eventually they gave up.  One guy, Freddie, found a cigar here when he finished the Maze - he used to give it to whoever wanted it each day.  They'd smoke it, and the next day he'd wake up with a fresh one next to his bed."</p>
<p>"Why a cigar?"</p>
<p>"I think his daughter died of early-onset cancer."</p>
<p>Palmer blinked.  "Why did he leave the base?"</p>
<p>"There were four guys carrying the coffin - I don't think he had much of a choice."</p>
<p>She was starting to look bored, but there was lots more Palmer wanted to know.  "What's your Curse?" he asked her.</p>
<p>She swung her rucksack over her shoulder, and unzipped it.  From the inside she produced a bloody human head, and tossed it to Palmer.  He caught it by reflex then dropped it in horror, getting some blood on Jimjim in the process.</p>
<p>"It's the guy who walked out with all of my cash just when he'd got me pregnant."  Trudy gestured that he should pass it back to her, but Palmer just backed away.  She leaned over and rolled it back into her rucksack.  "No idea what happened to him.  This place just kinda gets under your skin, you know?  So anyway," she said, "that's why Morris got pissed off when you joked about his golf statue.  He hates that thing, but it's with him every day.  His wife left him for a golfer."</p>
<p>Palmer hugged Jimjim tight to his chest.  "I guess this could be a lot worse, then."</p>
<p>Trudy snorted.  "Sure could."</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Back at the entrance to the base, Palmer began to walk back to his caravan.  He stopped, feeling foolish, and set off instead in the opposite direction.  He should know more about this place if he was going to be here for any length of time.</p>
<p>He was quickly stopped by a guard.</p>
<p>"ID, please."  Palmer followed the procedure - palms out, open, left hand reaches to your front pocket while you smile at the solider.  Every schoolchild in America had been taught this since the suicide bombings had turned Detroit into an economic wasteland: one of Palmer's playschool friends had been shot for reaching behind himself to his rear pocket.  The soldier got a minor medal for vigilance.</p>
<p>The guard examined the pass, and saluted.  "Sorry, sir."</p>
<p>Palmer hesitated.  "What?"</p>
<p>"I didn't recognise you, sir.  I shall from now on, sir."  The guard saluted again.</p>
<p>Palmer looked at his 'dent card and found it had been updated remotely.  The white paper had turned green, and his name now read as Brigadier General Palmer Jones, 0-7, USAF.</p>
<p>The guard was still saluting.  "What's your name, officer?"</p>
<p>"Rogers, sir!"  The guard, Rogers, coughed.  "I am not an officer, sir!"</p>
<p>"Right."</p>
<p>"Permission to ask a question, sir?"</p>
<p>"Of course," said Palmer, as grandly as he was able.</p>
<p>"Will you require an umbrella for your teddy bear, sir?"</p>
<p>Palmer glanced down to the crook of his elbow and realised he had been carrying Jimjim the whole time he was walking.</p>
<p>"Ah, no - and actually, I'm not sure this is really mine.  I found it in -"</p>
<p>"Sir!"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"I have been instructed that I am not of sufficient rank to inquire about anything on this base which might seem strange, sir!"</p>
<p>"Oh."  Palmer hesitated, feeling he ought to have some natural response to this.  "Could I promote you?"</p>
<p>Rogers's expression had so far been impassive and obedient, but at this point a look of disbelief flickered in to existence and was gone again.  A slight Southern tinge entered his voice.</p>
<p>"I don't think that would be appropriate, sir."</p>
<p>"Right."  Palmer's hands were sticky and without being conscious of the motion he adjusted his grip on Jimjim, hugging it closer to his torso.  He began chewing his thumbnail.</p>
<p>Rogers shifted his weight from foot to foot.  He gave up trying to understand why what seemed to be an overgrown child had the 'dent card of a Brigadier General and just started to do the right thing.  He saluted.</p>
<p>"Sir, is there anything I can do for you, sir?  I could show you to Colonel Blake."</p>
<p>"No!" said Palmer quickly, "I - no, thank you."</p>
<p>Rogers grinned.  "Right you are, sir.  Where to, then?"</p>
<p>"I was told I had to report to a work detail Seven."  Rogers nodded.</p>
<p>"Please come with me, sir," he said, and led the way to the mess hall.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>"You!  Boy!  Wash those dishes properly!" shouted the head chef.  "You think you're too good for dishes because they call you a general?"</p>
<p>"No, sir," stammered Palmer, "I-"</p>
<p>"Don't call me sir, idiot!  Do I look like a general to you?  You call me chef."  The head chef waddled up and glowered in Palmer's large face.  "You making fun of me, boy?"</p>
<p>"No, chef."</p>
<p>"Clean."  The head chef aimed raised his right fist as though to give Palmer a backhanded blow to his face, and he laughed when Palmer flinched violently.  "Pink little shit."</p>
<p>The kitchen was L-shaped, and fitted out with cabinets made of cheap MDF.  The sideboards on the left hand side of the long leg were entirely covered by electric hobs, while the right hand side was topped entirely with grooved chopping-board plastic, the grooves leading down into channels that had a grated trough standing underneath them; periodically someone would throw a bucket of water over their part of the side and wash the cuttings down onto the grating of the trough.  There was no distinction made here between vegetables and meat, and the grating was thick with furry grey mold.</p>
<p>Palmer was stationed at one of the four sinks on the short leg of the L, washing sharp knives and tin spoons; immediately to his left, at the end of the short leg, there stood four enormous ovens blasting out heat.  To his right there was another sink at which a private with only two fingers on his left hand stood, and behind that private there was another, this one with a criss-cross of scars around his eyes.  Both of them were peeling potatoes.  There was nowhere to hang his jacket, and so Palmer stood sweating into his General's uniform.</p>
<p>The cook waddled over with another sack of dirty dishes, and poured them into his sink.  Palmer couldn't look away from the cook's wispy moustache, each hair so thin and fine it reminded him of the hair on a middle-aged woman, and the sweat on his forehead that merged into his bald pate.  The cook, whose name Palmer didn't even know, saw him staring.  He stepped forwards twice, quickly, so close their bodies were touching for most of their length, and spoke with foul breath.</p>
<p>"You got a problem, boy?"</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>
<p>The cook narrowed his eyes and waddled off.</p>
<p>Palmer turned his attention back to the sink, now full of dirty crockery and cutlery.  He picked up a grey bowl and ran his finger around the inside to check how dirty it was - it seemed pretty clean, maybe used for cereal or porridge.  These wouldn't take long.  He turned and stepped across the narrow room, a beadlet of sweat starting its way down his large face, and began to fill the sink opposite his workstation with clear and clean water for rinsing.  He stepped back to the dirty dishes and began to scrub.</p>
<p>He worked up a stack of twelve clean bowls, stacked in fours on the corner of his sink, and began transferring them to the sink he was using for rinsing behind him.  The plug had popped out, presumably from the pressure of the cold tap hitting it straight on, and so Palmer popped it back in.  He turned back to get another four bowls, then turned back to find the plug had popped out again.  He put it back in, firmly, and turned around.</p>
<p>The cold tap on his sink was running first blast, and the water - already high - was beginning to slop over the sides onto the floor.  The private whose sink was to his right was looking over his shoulder at him.  When they made eye contact, Palmer dropped his face down towards his sink and stepped forwards, starting to scrub again.  He had always been told by his teachers to just ignore bullies.</p>
<p>When he turned around again the plug was out again.  He put it back in and started rinsing the bowls he had washed so far, stacking them on the draining boards set above the sinks like wire shelving.  He before turning back to the sink of dirty dishes he put the plug in again and turned on both taps full blast.  Some sweat dripped from his brow, half from the intense heat and half from the sick feeling that was starting to grow in his stomach.</p>
<p>When he turned back to the sink with his dirty dishes in, he found someone had thrown a soil-covered potato into the water, then spat phlegm into the water for good measure.  He kept his head bent towards his work, like he'd been taught, and fished out the potato.  The sink was filled to the brim with crockery, and there was no way to drain it to get rid of the phlegm, so he scooped it into a dirty bowl and balanced it on the side of the sink to deal with later.</p>
<p>He turned back to his clean sink to find another potato in it.  He looked up at the scarred private working to his left and found he was staring straight at him, smirking.  Palmer felt his face tighten, and as he watched, the scarred private casually picked up another dirty potato from his sink and casually tossed it into Palmer's rinsing water, turning the water into a dark thin mud.</p>
<p>Palmer twisted himself away to his dirty sink again, his stomach acid now burning and his eyes tense from holding back childish tears.  He would wash as many plates as he could carry, then turn and rinse them straight under the tap.  Without thinking, he scooped out another wad of phlegm with his bare hands and tipped it into the bowl he had put aside.</p>
<p>For twenty-five minutes he worked that way, the dirty dishes slowly depleting in front of him and the clean dishes slowly appearing on the shelves behind him.  He tugged out the plug of the dirty sink and started to rinse the foul water away; while the water did its work he headed towards the corner of the 'L', squeezing between the buttocks of the two privates as he did so, and picked up the next heavy bag of dirty crockery.  He laboriously tipped it out, as the cook had done, stuffed the empty sack below the sink, and turned on the hot tap.  The dirty sink began to refill, and behind him he heard a short and low smash.</p>
<p>He turned off his left foot, keeping his front to the scarred and injured privates, and stepped around with his right foot to look.  His foot, still wearing his cheap gym shoes, did not make contact with the tiled floor but landed on something sharp and hard that had no friction beneath it.</p>
<p>The floor was covered in broken clean crockery, and both men were watching him and smiling.  Behind him, the four ovens sizzled.</p>
<p>He stepped forward to get away from the end of the short edge of the 'L', and the ovens.  Neither the scarred private nor the injured private moved to allow him to pass.</p>
<p>"Pick it up," the scarred private said.</p>
<p>Palmer stood, a wet and dirty sponge still in his right hand dripping on the floor.  He did not bend down to pick up the broken shards of plate.  The injured private took a step forwards, causing Palmer to take an instinctive half-step back in response.  He felt the heat of the ovens on his neck, hot enough to sting.</p>
<p>"He told you," growled the injured private, "pick it up."</p>
<p>Palmer felt his hands began to shake.  If he knelt down to pick up the crockery it was obvious that they would kick him in the face, and if he stood there without obeying them they would shove him against the ovens and he would be badly burned.  As he panicked he noticed that he had bent his head down towards his chest and raised his hands up against his temples, bending his knees as though by making a token effort he would avoid physical punishment.  He knew that he looked mentally disabled, and that this was even more likely to make them hurt him.  He felt, rather than saw, the injured private raise his right arm and clench his fist -</p>
<p>TODO: Byrne arrives and protects him. Palmer leaves his work shift, and they pursue him, toying with him (they're military, after all).  They corner him, he wets himself, Schmidt appears and takes him straight to his psych appraisal, his trousers still soaked with piss.</p>
<p>TODO: This conversation with Rogers is good - cut it and move it up to when they meet.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>After several hours someone knocked.  It was a private.<br />
The private was looking at him carefully.</p>
<p>"Sir?" He asked. "My name is Rogers, sir.  Sergeant Byrne asked me to show you to your psyche evaluation."</p>
<p>"A psyche evaluation?  That didn't take long," said Palmer, bitterly.</p>
<p>"Oh, no sir.  This is a regular part of joining Grey Base, sir.  Everyone has to meet Dr. Schmidt."</p>
<p>Stepping outside Palmer swayed in surprise.  The other caravans were gone.  Seeing his look, Rogers explained.</p>
<p>"The object grew past the next checkpoint, sir, so the whole camp gets moved out another five miles."  He lowered his voice.  "Although technically, sir, I'm not supposed to know that there is any such object, sir.  Sorry, sir."</p>
<p>They hooked up Palmer's caravan to the waiting Jeep.  Through this, Rogers visibly relaxed, the autumn air bringing out the rose in his cheeks.  Perhaps Byrne had overstated how helpless this man was.</p>
<p>"Could I get a map of the base?" Asked Palmer.</p>
<p>Rogers frowned.  "No sir, in case it fell into enemy hands."  He brightened, his cheeks positively glowing.  "But it's the same layout as every other USAF base, sir."</p>
<p>They got in to the Jeep and Rogers started driving them out.</p>
<p>"I never knew that," said Palmer, "about the layout, I mean."</p>
<p>"It's classified, sir.  Civilians aren't allowed to know."</p>
<p>Palmer thought.  "Describe the base to me - the layout.  Where do people eat?"</p>
<p>Rogers grinned.  "During the day we we eat in the canteen - there's an officer's table - and each evening we eat on Schmidt's Green."  At Palmer's questioning look he continued "He's running an experiment to improve morale.  It's different every evening.  Sir." He added, plainly remembering himself.</p>
<p>---<br />
TODO: I like this schedule idea.  Perhaps we could actually use it, rather than ignore it.<br />
---</p>
<p>Rogers described the base in detail, and explained what Palmer's schedule would be.  Each morning there would be meetings "though I don't know more than that, sir", and each afternoon was for researching the object.  "I'm your assigned driver, sir, for each afternoon."  Rogers saw the object as solid grey, and as far as he knew so did all the other enlisted men.</p>
<p>The breeze of the Jeep's transit was pleasant, if somewhat chilly.</p>
<p>Eventually, they reached the field hospital, and Palmer dismounted.  He thanked Rogers and wandered in to the reception area.  Schmidt immediately appeared, his barrel chest of thick muscle and fat under a white lab coat, looking for all the world like a giant light bulb.</p>
<p>"Research indicates that tardiness is symptomatic of regressive infantilism," he observed.  "You are late."</p>
<p>"Am I?" Asked Palmer.  "Even though no-one told me this was scheduled?"</p>
<p>Dr. Schmidt twisted his mouth up like a piece of wire.</p>
<p>"Come in," he said, turning away, "and bring your teddy bear with you."</p>
<p>Palmer jumped, and dropped Jimjim from his left hand.  He had been holding him the whole time?  Through the whole conversation with Rogers?</p>
<p>"Lie down on the couch," said Schmidt over his shoulder, standing at the sink.  He finished washing his hands and donned a pair of white rubber gloves, then began washing his hands again immediately, now with the gloves on.</p>
<p>"I thought this was just a psyche exam?"</p>
<p>"It is," Dr Schmidt corrected, "a wellness appraisal.  Now, lie down on the couch!"</p>
<p>Palmer sat, then lay down fully.  He persisted.</p>
<p>"Why the gloves?"</p>
<p>"To keep my hands clean."</p>
<p>"But why?"</p>
<p>"For hygiene."</p>
<p>"Am I unhygienic?"</p>
<p>"Yes."  Dr Schmidt sat, took up his pen and pad, and asked: "How often do you wet yourself?"</p>
<p>Palmer flushed.</p>
<p>"I don't wet myself."</p>
<p>"Today I was informed that you had wet yourself.  Was that information incorrect?"</p>
<p>"No, but-"</p>
<p>"Do you understand the difference between telling the truth and lying?"</p>
<p>"No," said Palmer, lying.</p>
<p>Dr. Schmidt began to scribble in his pad.  It was marked JONES, P - SPECIAL.  The scribbling continued for several minutes.</p>
<p>"That was a joke," said Palmer.  Dr. Schmidt stopped writing and peered at him over his expensive but sensible eyeglasses.</p>
<p>"A joke," he stated.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Mr Jones, do you understand that this is a psychiatric examination?"</p>
<p>Palmer simply could not help himself.</p>
<p>"I thought this was a wellness appraisal," and he was gratified by the sight of Dr Schmidt's knuckles around his pen turning white.  He began scribbling in his pad once again.</p>
<p>"May I see what you're writing?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Eventually Dr. Schmidt exhausted his current material and looked up once more.</p>
<p>"Now, to return to my original question: why did you wet yourself today?"</p>
<p>Palmer did not correct him, but instead answered the question.</p>
<p>"I wet myself," said Palmer, his face burning red, "because Colonel Blake threatened to kill me to my face."</p>
<p>Dr Schmidt visibly started and immediately pressed a small black button set, recessed, into his desk.  Immediately a burly male orderly entered and, at Dr. Schmidt's gesture, went and stood over the psychiatrist's couch in which Palmer lay, directly between Palmer and Dr. Schmidt.  There was now a large desk and a large man between them, and communication became difficult.  Dr Schmidt continued as though nothing had happened.</p>
<p>"Do you understand the difference between telling the truth and lying?"</p>
<p>"Oh, for Pete's sake."</p>
<p>The burly orderly took that as a cue to extend his hands over Palmer's body as through ready to restrain him.</p>
<p>"Do you understand the difference between telling the truth and lying?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes I do."</p>
<p>---<br />
TODO: I like these things.  I suggest another flashback of Palmer's science teacher being dragged away for having falsified his RB results.<br />
---</p>
<p>"I haven't been forwarded your previous Rorschach-Benjamin results, so I do apologise if I'm covering ground your old therapist describes in his notes."</p>
<p>Palmer's blood ran cold.  The results of Rorschach-Benjamin evaluations were displayed openly on ident cards, and the mere fact of having had the evaluation was enough to disqualify someone from most engineering posts.  He answered very, very carefully.</p>
<p>"I have never had a Rorschach-Benjamin examination."</p>
<p>Dr. Schmidt wrote for several minutes.</p>
<p>"Did you dislike your previous therapist?"</p>
<p>Palmer was conscious of sweat on his forehead.</p>
<p>"I have never previously had a therapist, nor had cause to seek treatment from a therapist."</p>
<p>Dr Schmidt attempted to eye him narrowly, an effect which was ruined by his having to lean quite far to the side to avoid the large desk and burly orderly to do so.  "Do you dislike therapists in general?  Imagine you were to have had one that you did not wish to tell me about.  Would you say that you disliked that person?"</p>
<p>"I do not understand the question."</p>
<p>Dr. Schmidt ticked what seemed to be a very large checkbox, then turned over a fresh page.</p>
<p>The Sun was past its zenith, now, but the combination of early cloud cover and high winds meant that now was the moment when the light broke through clearly.  It was perhaps 3pm in the afternoon.</p>
<p>"Why do you carry a teddy-bear around?"</p>
<p>Palmer, now conscious of the gravity of the situation, responded as conservatively and giving as much weight to social conformity as he could.</p>
<p>"This teddy-bear was discovered by me during my initial investigation of the Maze, where-"</p>
<p>"Stop!"  Dr. Schmidt pressed a button to pause a tape recorder Palmer had not previously realised was running.  "I don't have clearance to know anything about the object more than I already know."</p>
<p>Palmer rubbed his face.  "You are tasked with judging whether my actions are sane, but in an unusual situation that you are forbidden from even trying to understand?  I don't see that working."</p>
<p>Dr. Schmidt lit up as though Palmer had finally won some sort of simple prize, like a rat in a cage with a food-lever, or a child playing on a pinball machine at a fun fair.</p>
<p>"Quite right."  He scribbled again, and Palmer wondered if he had undone at least some of the damage.  "Now, Palmer, please cover your ears, close your eyes and hum a happy tune.  I have to make a recommendation regarding your care."</p>
<p>Regardless of Palmer's feelings about this instruction the burly orderly had leaned down and placed his own hands over Palmer's ears, pushing painfully hard.  Palmer, laying defenceless on his back, had no option but to comply, or else risk violence from this obedient medical muscle.  He closed his eyes, but found he could clearly hear Dr. Schmidt speaking into his tape recorder.</p>
<p>"Severe retardation, infantile regression, paranoid delusions, with lucid patches.  Recommend permanent institutionalisation on completion of Project Albatross.  Subject to be guided at all times where allowed by clearance levels."</p>
<p>Palmer wet himself.</p>
<p>---<br />
TODO: I like the ending of this scene.  Perhaps more physical scene setting.<br />
