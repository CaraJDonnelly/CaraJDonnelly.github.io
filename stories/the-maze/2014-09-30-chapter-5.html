Chapter V<br />
---</p>

TODO: Cold war timeline<br />
----<br />
General Morris had never been a happy man.  He had loved his wife, who even now played golf professionally, but her success left him feeling superfluous, ever unwanted.  He had risen through the ranks of the Air Force not, he felt, not because of his skills, his competences or experiences in the theatre of war, but rather because he had never been interesting enough to rebel even the small amount required to make unsuitable friends.  Bohemian friends.</p>
<p>He had never smoked dope.  God, he wanted to smoke dope.  Just one joint, the agitprop assured him, was enough to turn you into a violent delinquent.</p>
<p>God, he wanted to be a violent delinquent.</p>
<p>He had been listening to the reports from the base commander, his chief materials engineer, and Dr. Schmidt.  Happily none of them were close enough to smell the guilty smell of Scotch on his breath.  The men were unhappy.  Fine.  The Maze had resisted another form of attack.  Acid, this time.  Fine.  The two subjects that could enter the maze (that were not part of command staff) appeared to have become a dangerous romantic relationship.  Fine.</p>
<p>TODO - give Schmidt more of a reason to think that there's a dangerous romantic relationship going on.</p>
<p>Hell, good luck to them.  He ruminated.</p>
<p>"Is there any other kind?" he asked, rhetorically.</p>
<p>The nagging of the ants bothered him - that's right, they were ants, all three of them, faceless drones who had never gone against the nest.  He was an ant too, a bigger ant that could swallow up the smaller ones if he wished, but still just an ant.  The kind of animal that withers away when put under the magnifying glass.</p>
<p>His comment hadn't been a sequiteur.  Apparently, some amount of conversation had passed whilst he was ruminating and the topic had been quick-drying concrete.  The ants started enumerating different kinds of concrete.  It seemed there were many kinds of concrete, and that quick-drying was indeed not the only kind.</p>
<p>He didn't look at the plastic statuette.  He looked at the ants.  Right in their eyes.</p>
<p>---<br />
"Did the General seem distracted to you today?" said the materials engineer.</p>
<p>"Perfectly normal," said Dr. Schmidt.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Palmer's body was shaped all wrong, all hairy, and he couldn't speak because of the beard that was growing down his throat.</p>
<p>Tomorrow came, and the inside of the Maze was leafy and quiet.  Palmer had come here alone; Byrne and Rogers had had no choice but to wait outside, since to them it was solid Grey.  There was no point stopping him from entering, either - that was the whole reason he had been brought here.</p>
<p>A thought came to him. He plucked a leaf and hurried back to the entrance.</p>
<p>"Here," he said, the leaf small in the palm of his out-held hand.  "What's this?"</p>
<p>At a nod from Byrne, Rogers set off to the guards at the nearby checkout at a dead run.  Palmer dropped the leaf into Byrne's hands.</p>
<p>"It's a small Grey disc," said Byrne.</p>
<p>"To me it's a leylandii leaf."</p>
<p>A HazMat team appeared over the horizon and was approaching with sirens blaring.  Palmer expected Byrne to pass the leaf back to him and move back to allow them access to him, but he just stood there, shaking his head.</p>
<p>"Quarantine.  We'll be in the unit for at least six months.  No-one's managed what you just did before."</p>
<p>"Six months?"</p>
<p>Byrne nodded.</p>
<p>Palmer rubbed his fingers together, contemplatively.</p>
<p>---<br />
TODO: This happens too quickly after Palmer arrives at the base.  Put in the passage of time.  Use the seasons to imply Palmer's emotional growth.  This needs to be the halfway point of the book.<br />
---</p>
<p>"No, thank you."  As the Hazmat team churned to a stop in front of them, their caterpillar tracks ripping up the field, Palmer stepped backwards into the Maze.</p>
<p>The HazMat team wore bulky radiation suits, air- and water-tight.  They passed Byrne a handheld radio and motioned that he should turn it on.  Their suits did not allow for communication with the outside world.  Byrne was led into the back of their van and the leaf placed, using large tongs, into a lead-lined steel container which was locked and loaded in after him.</p>
<p>Palmer was stood only a yard away and yet not one of the men paid him the slightest bit of attention.  He then understood that to them he was standing inside what might as well be solid rock.  He had known that before - now, watching the HazMat team scurry around like insects, he understood it.</p>
<p>He sat and watched as the team began spraying some chemical around.  The smell burned his eyes, nose and throat, and he backed away a little way up the central entrance-way of the Maze.</p>
<p>The first team left; a second team arrived and repeated the process twice more.  The corn stubble underneath where the spray touched hissed and turned black.</p>
<p>He sat, leaning against a leylandii, and considered Jimjim.  He could not shake him off, and he had been intending to ask for a rucksack, like Trudy's, to carry him around in.  It was nice to have him back.</p>
<p>Everyone had a different maze.  He thought back to the slides the General had shown him: bright orange rocks for the General, green and purple stripes for Trudy, and leafy green for him.  Trudy had walked through with him, though, on the same route.  Perhaps the different Mazes all had the same layout?  Or maybe it changed every time, and when two people came in it gave them the same layout.  He just didn't know.</p>
<p>Walking inwards he tried to find the starting point he had used yesterday - Yesterday! a lifetime ago - but the expansion overnight had made telling the narrow pathways apart difficult.</p>
<p>He sat down again.  Trudy said she had been here "from the start".  The original picture of some shrubs next to a pillbox was presumably the Maze in its infancy.  How long ago had that photograph been taken?  How much had the Maze grown?  They hadn't been surprised to find him, able to see the Maze for what it was - in fact they had been searching.  How many others had they found?</p>
<p>Where were they now?</p>
<p>---<br />
He was thirteen, and he was cycling with his father.<br />
---</p>
<p>He woke to find the Sun low in the sky, and his stomach rumbling.  Back at the entrance he found a phalanx of guards waiting, guns pointing like long fingers at the entrance-way and a HazMat team far behind on standby.  Their faces were blank and violent as they stared into the impenetrable Grey wall.  They had orders.</p>
<p>He walked up to the side of the entrance, keeping within the boundary, and broke off a large twig.  He tossed it out.</p>
<p>The soldiers open fire.  He felt the bullets whizz past him to where he had been standing moments ago.  He also heard a loud crack-crack ahead; he saw half the bullet, or copies of the bullets, had simply struck the Maze boundary and rebounded.  That seemed about as reasonable as anything else that could have happened.</p>
<p>The soldiers didn't stop shooting, and Palmer found he was in fact pinned against the side hedge off which he had broken the twig.  He tried to push his way backwards into the hedge as he had at the inner circle of the Maze, but the leylandii suddenly seemed thicker to him.  They were completely impenetrable unless he severely injured himself.</p>
<p>The soldiers didn't stop shooting.  They now began to fan out around the entrance of the Maze, firing blindly inwards.  Their bullets, to them, rebounded off the edge of the Maze, but now Palmer could clearly see the bullet splitting in to two, one copy falling to the floor, one carrying on unimpeded to the inside.</p>
<p>One struck him in the eye.</p>
<p>---<br />
TODO: I like the fact that he gets shot - it removes his eye - but this kind of puts paid to him later hiding out in the Maze because it's just the same thing happening again.  Let him be shot and have him collapse outside of the Maze, or something.  Let him run away and be shot trying to escape - lasso him back out, somehow.<br />
---</p>
<p>He flew South, and East, and Down?  Ahead, seagulls wheeled and cried.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Trudy was kicking him awake.</p>
<p>"Wake up!  You're frozen solid."  He rolled over, and she went pale at the sight of his face.  "Oh, God."</p>
<p>Palmer tried to open his eyes, and only the right one responded.  His basic survival instincts had taken him, unconscious, and made him somehow manage to make his way deeper into the Maze, and worm his way right underneath one of the hedges before he slept; the foliage here was thick, and he was right on the edge of the ditch that circled the centre.</p>
<p>"How the hell did you find me?"  He tried to sit up, but couldn't.  He at least wasn't cold - although shouldn't he be cold, sleeping outside?  The Maze obviously didn't count as "outside" in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>Trudy was dragging him up to his feet.  "We have to get you to a doctor.  You're still bleeding."</p>
<p>"Someone shot me in the eye."</p>
<p>"I can see that."</p>
<p>They stumbled outwards, him almost unconscious and leaning on her and trusting her to lead the way, but today the Maze was literally the spokes of a wheel - he could see, even with only one eye, straight to the edge.  The Maze changed, then.</p>
<p>"We'll get there soon."</p>
<p>"I feel okay."  He did feel okay.  His body felt awful - his right hand was throbbing with his new scar and wouldn't flex properly, and his left eye was simply gone - but he felt like he had woken up with a good hangover.  The kind of hangover that means that last night you worked something important out and things are going to be better because today you are a stronger person.</p>
<p>"You should be dead," she said.  "I came down to see what was going on, and they were shooting the walls for hours."</p>
<p>"Maze protected me, maybe."  He shuffled onwards.  "The bullets were being copied when they hit the outside, and coming in.  Maybe if there were twelve men shooting and one of me inside, I was only hit by one thirteenth of a bullet?"</p>
<p>"Shh."</p>
<p>---<br />
He was in an amusement park, riding the hall of mirrors the wrong way.  A beautiful woman stroked his right hand and the world turned bright white.<br />

"Careful, nurse.  He's messed himself."<br />
