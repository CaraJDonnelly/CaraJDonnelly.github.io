TODO: Cold war timeline<br />

TODO: Blake character detail should go much, much earlier.</p>
<p>Colonel Blake thought nothing much of Doctor Schmidt, but then he didn't think much about any person past their rank in the US military hierarchy.  Occasionally he would satisfy himself that he still new exactly how many lieutenants must die before it becomes right to sacrifice a captain.</p>
<p>He is a solider, driven insane by US propaganda promising Peace On Earth, and he is a wholly inadequate lens to focus on this story.  However, everyone else is dead, unavailable or impossible.</p>
<p>Colonel Blake led the phalanx of guards through the base and into the square.  In their centre, their unconscious prisoner was borne on a stretcher.  Yesterday this had been a graveyard for the newly-deceased General Morris - today it would serve as a court of military law.</p>
<p>He spoke.</p>
<p>TODO: I like this game.  Play it slower, play it for several beats.</p>
<p>"In military law one may only be judged by a superior officer.  The accused has the rank of a Brigadier General and so is the highest ranking officer alive in this base."  Colonel Blake announced from the priest's podium.  "However, I have ordered Dr. Schmidt to issue a medical demotion in light of the accused's recent crimes.  I shall act as the judge."</p>
<p>"He's coming around, sir," said one of the soldiers guarding the accused.</p>
<p>"Thank you, private," replied Blake.</p>
<p>Palmer jerked awake and nearly strangled himself on the leather strap holding down his neck.  He was completely immobilised by what felt like similar straps down his body's length.</p>
<p>Above him, the sky was a pale blue with some diffuse white clouds, and it was bordered by the green-shirted shoulders of soldiers staring straight ahead.</p>
<p>"Where am I?" He asked.</p>
<p>The soldiers, acting on some unseen signal, raised him to a 45 degree angle and locked the gurney into place.</p>
<p>Colonel Blake stood at a podium alone in an empty field, grass stretching out behind him.</p>
<p>"Gag the prisoner," he ordered, and it was done.</p>
<p>"Palmer Jones, Captain, formerly Brigadier General, 65532124601, you stand accused of disobeying orders in a time of national crisis, that is, treason.  The punishment for treason is death.  Do you have anything to say in your defence, bearing in mind that you were stripped of your right to address the court for medical reasons?"  Without pausing, Colonel Blake went on.  "In which case, I-"</p>
<p>"Colonel, I would like to speak," said Dr. Schmidt, stepping forward into Palmer's field of vision.</p>
<p>"The court informs Dr. Schmidt that medical insanity or infirmity is not a valid defence in the court of military justice."</p>
<p>"No, no," said Dr. Schmidt, glowing.  "I have reason to believe that this body before us is not Palmer Jones at all."</p>
<p>A slight edge of tension entered the frame of Colonel Blake.</p>
<p>"Think," Schmidt continued, "of the man I examined upon his arrival at Grey Base.  My records will show him to be a halfwit, a man incapable of attaining even basic military funding for his chosen field of study.  Throughout his short stay he was ensnared romantically by a murderess, walked into a hail of bullets, and formed a pathetic attachment to a wretched child's toy."</p>
<p>Neither Blake nor Schmidt knew of the Curses, of course; a medical mind, like a military mind, is unable to conceive of anything that it was not spoon-fed.</p>
<p>"Are we to believe that this imbecile - and I use the term in its technical sense - had the ability to survive unaided for over a month within a hostile alien object?  No.</p>
<p>"No, Palmer Jones as we knew and understood him is dead.  This doppelganger is some manifestation of the unknown powers that assail our nation."</p>
<p>Blake stared at Schmidt in alarm.  "Men, shoot the alien imm-"</p>
<p>"Stop!" cried Dr. Schmidt.  "You will ruin the specimen."</p>
<p>The men paused, their rifles aimed at Palmer from six directions.  All he could feel was an absurd relief that this time he had managed to face adversity without pissing himself, and lost in the juxtaposition of humanity's fate and human dignity he giggled through his gag.</p>
<p>The soldiers around him heard the giggle and backed away a step, their hands tightening around their guns and fear showing plain in their faces.<br />
Perhaps giggling wasn't such a clever idea.</p>
<p>TODO a little more humming and hawing from Blake, here.  Continuation of the earlier game.  Have Schmidt threaten him with demotion.</p>
<p>"Take the specimen back to the medical centre immediately," said Dr Schmidt.  "I must begin my preparations."</p>
<p>As Palmer's world shifted and lurched he saw the fear and hatred on the faces of the soldiers intensify.  One of them was Rogers.  Palmer's brow relaxed as a wave of sorrow passed over him, and he decided that he should sleep whilst he could.</p>
<p>---<br />
He dreamt of working as a young man with his father; together they are building a table.  His father knows that this is only a dream, that he is not here in the living world, and hugs Palmer all the harder for it.<br />

<p>TODO perhaps a chapter break here?  The scene after these needs an edit.</p>
<p>Palmer Jones awoke to find himself strapped to a chair.  Over his entire body was a broad square cage, and the room felt tense.  There was a smell of ozone.</p>
<p>Dr Schmidt was sat opposite him, outside the cage.  He was again armed with a clipboard and not one but two recording devices.  He started the tape on both of them.</p>
<p>"Examination one of the alien subject begins March 3rd, 1978, 1132 hours.  Subject was captured last night attempting to infiltrate Grey Base in the guise of an escaped mental patient, Palmer Jones, who had been stationed at the base to aid in our investigation of the alien structure known colloquially as the Maze.</p>
<p>"Subject was contained successfully and did not exhibit any unusual abilities.  Protocol is to conduct a preliminary interview before taking medical samples.</p>
<p>"First," he said, now addressing Palmer.  "What is your name?"</p>
<p>"Palmer Jones," he replied.</p>
<p>Dr Schmidt pressed a small button and Palmer received a sharp electric shock.  Dr Schmidt addressed the microphone.  "To induce co-operation the alien subject will be given a series of increasing electric shocks upon lying."  To Palmer."  "What is your name?"  Palmer hesitated - the shock had been painful.  Given a moment longer to think he would later have had to feel mildly guilty about the decision that he then made, but Dr Schmidt took the hesitation as a cue to shock him again.  The second shock was noticeably more painful, and Palmer opened his mouth to lie as best he could whilst informing the military of the changes he had seen within the Maze.</p>
<p>"We don't have names.  You could call me One."</p>
<p>"One?" asked Dr Schmidt in alarm.  "Are more of you coming?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>A painful shock.</p>
<p>"Yes.  Hundreds."</p>
<p>"I remind you," said Dr Schmidt.  "Any falsehood will earn you a shock."</p>
<p>Palmer nodded.  Schmidt's hand hovered over the button.</p>
<p>"I understand."  Schmidt's hand relaxed.</p>
<p>"Is the Maze hostile?  Was it sent by the Communists?"</p>
<p>"Yes, the Maze is hostile.  It is alien in origin."  No shock.</p>
<p>"Is there a corresponding Maze that threatens the Soviets?"</p>
<p>Palmer searched his memory for anything that General Morris might have said.  "No.  This Maze is unique on this planet."  No shock.</p>
<p>"Why has the Maze accelerated its expansion suddenly?"</p>
<p>Palmer leaned forwards as best he could given the restraints.  "The man Byrne allowed the Maze to experience human death for the first time, and -"</p>
<p>A harsh shock, longer than the others had been.  Dr Schmidt stared disapprovingly at Palmer.</p>
<p>"Byrne was not the first death in the Maze."  He widened his bulbous eyes as though trying to hypnotise Palmer.  "Why has the Maze accelerated its growth?"</p>
<p>Palmer, nonplussed, responded without thinking.  "Then I don't know."</p>
<p>He blacked out from the next shock.  When he came around, Dr Schmidt was repeating his question, and Palmer desperately gave the most anodyne response he could find.</p>
<p>"Nearing completion," he muttered, his mouth full of blood - he must have bitten his tongue, hard, during the pain.</p>
<p>"What does that mean?"  Schmidt was standing, now, shouting over his desk like a short order chef.  "What is completion?"</p>
<p>Palmer, his head swimming, said "The egg hatches."<br />
Quick as a flash Dr Schmidt was on his feet and had pressed a button to summon his burly male orderly.  He spoke into the microphone.</p>
<p>"Due to alarming statements made in preliminary interview it is curtailed here.  Moving to inform high command whilst my assistant collects medical samples and neutralises the creature."  To his assistant:  "Remove its teeth."</p>
<p>The assistant nodded, and picked up a pair of pliers.</p>
