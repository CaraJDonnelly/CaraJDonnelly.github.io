TODO: Cold war timeline<br />

The Maze ceased growing abruptly.  Portland survived unscathed.  Hundreds of thousands of people continued to live there, unaware that they had been saved.  The nuclear weapons Blake had been transporting were quietly lowered to the ground by forces unseen, where they were absorbed into the soil, never to be heard of again.</p>
<p>Trudy vanished into the South, driving the Jeep Palmer had stolen and avoiding the patrols.  She cries, occasionally, and is grateful for the ability.  Her last memory of the Maze is not the look in Palmer's blind eyes as he accepted death, nor the painful means by which he passed, but the white and pale pink flowers which had sprouted and begun to bloom as she made her way out.</p>
<p>After an initially slow response, thanks in no small part to the havoc created by the insubordination of Colonel Blake, the US Government cordoned off the affected region and began a program of rerouting the major freeways so that it was essentially inaccessible.  The farmers affected were compensated generously and relocated to Iowa, and Colonel Blake was awarded a posthumous medal.</p>
<p>The Maze was now visible to all comers as interwoven beds of lilies and peonies.  It continued to blossom, content within its attained borders, and continued to offer any that completed it a token that they would find very difficult to bear, and very difficult to lose.  After brief consultation with the USSR Council of Ministers the US Government erected a 20 foot fence five miles from the Maze perimeter, and forbade any personnel from entering on pain of execution.</p>
