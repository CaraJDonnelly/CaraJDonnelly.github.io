The pillbox was small, and bare except for a cot and some shelving containing canned goods.  He was alone.</p>
<p>He focused right eye on his right hand.  The scar had not healed - in fact it had grown a violent red coating, and begun to ooze.  He was thirsty.</p>
<p>Trudy was suddenly there, shaking off mud.  He showed her his hand, and she looked at it.  "Need antibiotics."</p>
<p>She dug through the shelves and passed him a pill bottle.  He squinted.</p>
<p>"These are out of date."</p>
<p>"There aren't any others."</p>
<p>"The doctor at the base will have some."</p>
<p>"Not for you.  You can see inside - you and me are condemned.  No medicine."</p>
<p>He blinked, his cheek burning as he did so, and slowly swallowed a pair of expired antibiotic pills.  Trudy continued.</p>
<p>"They don't give medicine to us if they can possibly avoid it.  The others all committed suicide, so they figure it's not worth it."</p>
<p>Time clicked.  He was back on the bunk, she on top of him, kissing him with urgent hunger.  "No," he said, "sick."  They slept, and he did not dream.</p>
<p>They woke in the early evening, and made love.  Palmer had been a virgin, and was never sure where to put his hands.  Trudy was on her period, and the military base had refused to supply sanitary towels.  Things got messy.</p>
<p>Afterwards Trudy dug some stale cigarettes from the provisions on the shelf and passed one to Palmer.  They drank some water.</p>
<p>"Did you bury his body?" He asked.</p>
<p>She flinched.  "Whose body?"</p>
<p>"Byrne.  Did you bury his body?"</p>
<p>"No - I've hardly left the pillbox."</p>
<p>"You had mud on your trousers."</p>
<p>"I fell in the ditch," she said, shortly, and did not speak again.</p>
<p>Palmer drifted out-</p>
<p>-/the desert is full of a quiet form of life, scurrying-/</p>
<p>-and in, aware that he had grown feverish.  Whenever he woke, he stood and grabbed more tins, expending all his energy to do so.  Scooping them down to the messed bed, he ate them whenever he had the strength, dropping the empty tins down onto the pillbox floor.  The fever grew-</p>
<p>/-his fault, his fault she was dead-/</p>
<p>-worse, and Trudy was there with more pills and water and tinned food.  Eventually it broke, but as he came back to reality he became aware that his right hand itched in a permanent way, and his injured eye had simply lost all feeling.  The injuries, followed by a poorly-treated fever, had ruined them permanently.</p>
<p>He could not find his clothes, or his shoes, and so clad himself in the least-soiled of the sheets and pattered his way outside.  The Maze had grown thicker, much thicker, and was covered in snow - obviously at least a month had passed since Byrne's death.  He felt no wind, and could bear the chill.  His voice was weak and hoarse.</p>
<p>"Am I reborn?" He asked the Maze and the snow.</p>
<p>"No," said Trudy, "just older."</p>
<p>"Much older," he agreed, and turned to her with a smile. "I never see you walk up."</p>
<p>"You never do," she agreed, and looked at him steadily.  He turned away and ran his fingertips over the sharp holly spines of the nearest hedge.  It pricked him and he drew back; there was no sense risking his only hand.</p>
<p>"You look crazy," said Trudy.  "There's clothes inside, under the bed."</p>
<p>They entered and he dressed.  "You saved my life," he said, and kissed her on the cheek.  Her skin was cold, and they made love again.</p>
<p>"We should bury Byrne," he said, afterwards.  She shifted against him.  "You've already done it," he realised.</p>
<p>"I traded his corpse for fresh antibiotics, winter clothes and food," she said, flatly.  "They only just agreed to give us that."</p>
<p>He was quiet.  "Thank you," he eventually said.  "I would never have thought of forcing a trade.  What did they do to him?"</p>
<p>"They cut him up and got the density of Grey from it.  Now they know how heavy the Maze is and how much power it must be using to grow."</p>
<p>"It certainly has grown," he said.  "The corridors are hardly wide enough to fit along."</p>
<p>"I don't see it."</p>
<p>"I guess it's different for each person, then."</p>
<p>The two of them lay in the soiled bed; Palmer, conscious of the unsanitary conditions, reached out to move Jimjim.</p>
<p>Where was Jimjim?</p>
<p>Neither of them could find him, in the pillbox or around it.</p>
<p>"Where did you have it last?"</p>
<p>TODO: Have the scene where he puts down the bear.</p>
<p>"In the hospital.  I put away my things - as best I could - before coming to the - ..." he paused. "The killing."</p>
<p>"Guess it stayed there."  At Palmer's insistence she looked in her bag and confirmed that yes, her ex-boyfriend's head was still there.</p>
<p>"Something's changed," he said, getting vigorous.  "The first time someone has died in the Maze, and one of the Curses has stopped working.  We've got to go tell the General."  He started to walk to the door, but Trudy gave him a look and he stilled.</p>
<p>"It's four o'clock," she said.  "They'll be starting the bombardment soon."</p>
<p>On cue, the gentle pitter-patter of hailstones came into the pillbox.  Palmer moved again to open the door, but Trudy was there, blocking his path.</p>
<p>"Bullets.  An hour of bullets.  They're trying to kill us, and I don't see why I should die."</p>
<p>Palmer clenched his good fist, then opened it wide.  "OK," he said.  "What should we do?"</p>
<p>Trudy did not answer but took down a tin and began eating.  Palmer eventually did the same.  The sounds of rain, bullets upon the thick concrete pillbox, was almost as relaxing as the real thing.</p>
<p>----<br />
He held Trudy behind the barricade, keeping her safe and warm.<br />
