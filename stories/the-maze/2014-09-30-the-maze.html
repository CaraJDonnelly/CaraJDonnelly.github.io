<p>This is a work-in-progress of a short novel in the style of Philip K. Dick.  The conceit is that in the 1970s, during the Cold War, a small windowless building is discovered that appears to be slowly growing.  Some people can enter that building, and so they are conscripted into the military to try to deal with this apparent threat.</p>
<p>This really <em>is</em> my work-in-progress version.  You will find TODOs and notes to myself strewn throughout the text, and a lot more profanity (and indeed, violence) than I would use in a finished story, with no editing for style.  Only Palmer's storyline is complete, with the other threads are interspersed randomly.</p>
