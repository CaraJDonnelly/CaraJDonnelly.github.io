<p>Palmer's hands were big, and soft, like bleached baseball mitts stuck on the end of drainpipes.  They matched his head, with his big, soft, white face and mousy hair.  His shoes were white, and he wore pale colours underneath his apron.  On good days, he blended in to the foreground of the coffee shop.</p>
<p>"Hey, Latino!  Hey!  We need some more coffee here!"</p>
<p>Palmer jerked, unsure whether the customers were speaking to him.  He was the only waiter on shift, but...</p>
<p>"I'm not Latino," he said, taking out his pad and pen.</p>
<p>"Shut up," said the big man eating cheap steak.  "You're a waiter, aren't you?  Only goddamn spics are waiters.  What are you getting that out for?  Coffee, I said, coffee."</p>
<p>"Coffee," agreed the big man eating cheap ribs sitting opposite him.</p>
<p>"Coffee," echoed Palmer weakly.  He walked to the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Those men were calling me Latino again, boss," he said to Hernandez, his manager.  "Could we throw them out?"</p>
<p>"What?  They're paying, aren't they?"  Hernandez snarled, spraying chew tobacco over the worktop.  "What's wrong with being Latino, boy?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, sir."  Palmer waited to be dismissed, silently.  Eventually, his boss spoke again.</p>
<p>"Shut the fuck up, Jones."  Hernandez dismissed him with another spray of tobacco.  "And clean this fucking counter."</p>
<p>Palmer started cleaning the worktops, then the vacant tables.  He became aware of someone standing behind him.</p>
<p>"Coffee."  The big man, no longer eating his cheap steak, said.  "Give me my fucking coffee."</p>
<p>Palmer shuffled to the kitchen and got a pot of coffee.  It was going to be a long Tuesday night.</p>
<p>------------------<br />
Musgrove College was ranked 202nd in the States for Engineering, and it celebrated this high position by investing in concrete as its building material of choice.  Its lecture halls were cold in the winter, boiling in the summer, and soul-crushing all year round.</p>
<p>Colonel Blake's entourage pulled up to the edge of the cedar-lined avenue.  The autumn air was cool, and the sky was clouded over.</p>
<p>Blake's driver opened his door and he rose, taking three short paces to stand at the foot of the concrete stairs that led to the main reception hall.  He had his orders.</p>
<p>Striding in to the clerical office, he flashed his 'dent card at the receptionist.</p>
<p>"Good morning, sir - " she started, surprised.</p>
<p>"This is a national emergency," he said, crisply.  Her eyes widened and she began to reach for the large blue button installed on every desk in the United States of the Americas - the General Alarm.  "A /top/ /secret/ national emergency.  You will sign these forms."  Her hand stilled en route and her mouth dropped open.</p>
<p>His lieutentant, Lieutenant Colonel Hacker, presented her with a precis of the Espionage Act, 1917, and the Freedom Act, 1949.  "By siining these you state that you understand the full implications of aiding the enemy, and are familiar in detail with all sections of the Freedom Act, including those sections not publically available.  Please sign here."</p>
<p>Hacker placed a pen in her hand and she signed immediately, her signature a shaky scrawl.</p>
<p>Blake spoke again.  "I need the full class list of all students, and a schedule for all lectures happening today.  Now."</p>
<p>The receptionist nodded.  Anything to get these men away from her.  She risked a quick smile.</p>
<p>Colonel Blake did not smile back.</p>
<p>---<br />
Musgrove Engineering Department was the place to be if you had anywhere else to go.  Palmer had nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>The topic of today's lecture was deformation of lattice-structures and the dangers it posed to bridge building.  Palmer had revised the work already, and so was disappointed when the lecturer - a short man with a runny nose and a moustache that shredded tissue paper - announced that today there would be an external guest lecturing instead.</p>
<p>"Please welcome," he sniffled, "Colonel Blake of the USAF."</p>
<p>Palmer applauded damply.  The crowd was mostly GI - government invested - students, ones that had won scholarships from the Government to study engineering to beat the Commies.  Palmer had had a cold on the day of the exam, and was so funding his own way through.</p>
<p>Colonel Blake stepped forwards, and Palmer was made curious by the blank look on his face.</p>
<p>"Students of engineering," Blake announced, "you have all been funded by the US Government for one reason, and for one reason only.  You are our secret weapon.  You are our weapon against the Red Menace, the threat which threatens to drag down all of humanity in its terrible clutches.  Only by the American people coming together and funding your education do we have a hope of beating Communism."</p>
<p>The hall was full of patriotic clapping.  Palmer again applauded damply.</p>
<p>"It is vital that at all times you are prepared for the worst so that you can make the best of every situation - so that you can build us a new America and indeed a new World Order, fighting to protect freedom from those that would destroy the very concept of private ownership itself."</p>
<p>"This lecture will involve a test of observation.  On your lecture rows you will find a set of papers with standard-issue pencils.  Please distribute these now."</p>
<p>Palmer took his paper and pencil when they passed.  He signed the declaration on the front which stated that he understood the Espionage and Freedom Acts, and turned to the next page.</p>
<p>"Please observe the overhead projector.  I shall now display a series of images.  For each image, please write no less than five hundred words describing each image.  Five hundred words, per each image.  Failure to write five hundred words for each image will result in a failing grade for this semester."</p>
<p>Palmer blinked; that didn't make sense as a punishment for a test that was so simple.  The clapping had risen to whoops and cheers, and he quickly applauded again.  "Yes!" the students around him cried, and so "Yes!" he cried out - "Fail us!  Fail us!".  It passed unremarked, and Palmer died a little bit more inside.  "Fail us!"</p>
<p>The first image was loaded on to the slide.  It was a picture of a pastoral scene, with a young milkmaid tending to a brown cow.  The GIs and the rest scribbled.</p>
<p>The second image was a fish trying to swallow a long sea snake.</p>
<p>The third image was a small concrete building in front of some hedges.</p>
<p>The fourth image was a Commie burning some money, with foreign road signs.</p>
<p>The fifth image was the Bomb, with a smiling American family giving a thumbs up in front of it.</p>
<p>The projector snapped off.</p>
<p>"Your time is up," announced Blake.  "Name and fold your papers, and pass them to the front."</p>
<p>His assistants stepped forwards and began sorting through the papers.  The entire test had taken no more than thirty minutes.  One sheet was picked out and handed to Blake.  He looked up into the theatre.</p>
<p>"Palmer Jones, please stand up."</p>
<p>Palmer stood, his heart sinking.</p>
<p>"Are you here on a Government scholarship?"</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>"In which case, you are under arrest for the propagation of subversive literature.  You will come with us."</p>
<p>Palmer swayed, but didn't faint.  He began to shuffle to the end of the row, squeezing past each student in turn.</p>
<p>"Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Thanks.  Thank you."  In the dead silence of the concrete lecture theatre everyone could hear perfectly his mumbled thanks, as the military funded students that surrounded him sat staring at him with patriotic loathing.  Not one of them attempted to move out of his way.</p>
<p>When he finally got free he was quickly handcuffed and marched out of the lecture theatre out through the empty hallways of the college and in to a Jeep that had been waiting with its engine running.  During the drive that followed the thing that stuck with him most was the disapproving sniffling of the short bald lecturer, mixing with the rhythmic knocking of the Jeep engine.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The hillside was covered with the stubble of recently-harvested corn.  Dr Ernst Schmidt was positively glowing with the sunset as he strode along the ridge, a stout wooden stave held firmly between the pudgy fingers of his right hand.</p>
<p>He did not know where in the United States of the Americas he currently stood, and he didn't much care; people were had the same defects in every place on the globe.  The air here was fresh, the earth warm from the afternoon's sun.</p>
<p>The experiments - /his/ experiments - were going fantastically.  His experiments would soon make him the most employable military psychiatrist in the entire US military, and therefore the world.  It was a shame, of course, that his case studies would necessarily remain classified - but he was confident that he could redress at least his most curious subject as a frustrated service employee that had moved to an unfamiliar city.  Perhaps someone who had fled from Detroit.  Yes, Detroit was an excellent base for the case he had in mind.  And in today's climate, the psychology a patient when placed in unfamiliar surroundings was a topic unlikely to go out of fashion - especially when the result had been murder.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Thirty-six hours later, Palmer was sat in a Jeep driving along the freeway in convoy, in handcuffs and manacles.</p>
<p>He hadn't slept - hadn't, in fact, been given any indication that he should sleep, or where he should sleep, or that sleep was a thing people did.  The soldier sat opposite him in the rear of the Jeep had sat bolt upright during all of that time, his hand on his holster.  Colonel Blake not only had not slept, he had been driving their Jeep at speed, and his constant patriotic monologue had grown more florid and more vicious in in its denunciation of Communism.  He kept up a steady stream of these inspirationals under his breath, as though constantly addressing a crowd of young men.</p>
<p>"You have to understand, boys, that what we're up against is nothing less than the threat of total annihilation of the human race, and not annihilation by death, by the fact of every American being extinguished, no, but the more insidious threat of our way of life being forgotten, being wiped from the history books like a photograph burned by a man without a face, by a man whose face, whose entire mode of thought, is dictated by the State - and that man without a face is precisely why we need - why I need, I, personally, as your commander, need your unswerving, unquestioning loyalty in what is to come..."</p>
<p>"You should get a radio show, " said Palmer to the back of his head.</p>
<p>Blake stiffened and fell silent, keeping his eyes on the road at all times.  Palmer shifted slightly in his seat and opened his mouth again.</p>
<p>"Because... you're so loyal," said Palmer.</p>
<p>Blake took a sharp left, too fast.</p>
<p>"It's inspirational."  Palmer's hands were starting to sweat against the cable ties around his wrists.  The soldier opposite him did not shift an inch.</p>
<p>Blake sped up.</p>
<p>"How loyal you are."</p>
<p>The silence, broken only by the sound of weak rain and a strong engine, was deafening.</p>
<p>The Jeep eventually arrived at Grey Base.  It was raining softly, and the winter dusk was dark.  He got an impression of squat buildings - no, caravans - behind a thick chain link fence guarded by tanks and men in grey with sallow faces.  Palmer was hauled out of the back of the Jeep, his legs unchained from one another, and he was unceremoniously pushed towards a small caravan with a bed in it.  Once inside, his handcuffs were removed and the door was locked behind him.  He rubbed his hands across his face and fell into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>-------------------</p>
<p>The ocean crashed against the beach, and the waves continued their millenia-long task of breaking the large, multi-volumed Russian encylcopaedias down into more readable translations that could be placed at the front of bookstores as the flavour of the month.  Eventually they would themselves be broken down into inspirational pamphlets about religion and meditation.  Palmer stretched his ostritch legs, and waddled across the books.  He found a soft spot of romantic fiction and worked his head down into the welcoming darkness.  If the villagers found him, they would be angry - why hadn't he built the marshmallow bridge like he was supposed to?</p>
<p>-------------------</p>
<p>He woke up, shuddering, and despite his exhaustion could not sleep until dawn.</p>
<p>-------------------</p>
