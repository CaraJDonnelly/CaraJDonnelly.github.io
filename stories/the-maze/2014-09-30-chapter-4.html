<p>Schmidt's Green turned out to be a region of flat stubble, previously cornfield, with three marquees erected upon it for the evening meal.  On Palmer's left stood Byrne, the lieutenant from before; Schmidt had informed him he was to have a guard and he had requested him specifically.</p>
<p>Palmer had a foul taste in his mouth he thought might be washed away by a beer.  He wiped his lips with the back of his hand.</p>
<p>His career was in ruins.  He had been publicly arrested and now diagnosed as mentally incompetent.  On the other hand, he was now a Brigadier General working on a top-secret military project.  The world had never seemed particularly sensible or benevolent to Palmer, and indeed he had found it mostly a source of confusion, but not it seemed to be actively resisting comprehension.</p>
<p>They walked up to the officer's table in the central marquee, and they sat in their assigned places.  Palmer's space only had a plastic spoon laid out.</p>
<p>"Listen," he said to Byrne, "this bear - I'm carrying it because - " but Byrne was shaking his head.</p>
<p>"I've got my orders, sir, and those orders are to mind my job and nothing more."</p>
<p>---<br />
TODO: Palmer sits in Blake's seat.</p>
<p>"At ease, Colonel," he said, hastily.</p>
<p>Colonel Blake's eyes bulged and he slowly lowered his hand to his side.  With a voice half strangled he spoke.</p>
<p>They entered a small office; Blake went and sat on the only chair behind the desk, leaving Palmer standing.  He became aware of how big Blake really was, and how physically dangerous he seemed, sitting and making chewing motions as though trying to gnaw through a bone.  When he did speak, it was loud enough to rattle the windowpanes.</p>
<p>"Maggot!"</p>
<p>"Wha-?"</p>
<p>"You!  Maggot!  You joke of an American who couldn't tie his own damn shoes without daddy's help.</p>
<p>"If you ever tell me 'at ease' again, or give me any order of any kind, I will kill you.  I might make it look like an accident," Blake continued, or I might just rely on the fact that no-one gives a single shit about you.</p>
<p>"Now get out, you piss-ridden Californian, and take your teddy-bear too."</p>
<p>Palmer became aware that he really had pissed himself from fear, the urine soaking through his trousers.  Blake seemed as some huge and terrible jinn.<br />
---</p>
<p>A server came around.  "The menu for tonight is minimum rations."</p>
<p>General Morris, sat at the head of the table, spluttered into his beer. "We've had that three nights running.  The men with revolt."</p>
<p>Palmer murmured "Is there a secret shortage of food?  Preventing public panic, that sort of thing?"</p>
<p>Byrne muttered back.  "Naw, this here is Dr Schmidt's attempt to improve morale."</p>
<p>"Minimum rations three days running?"</p>
<p>Byrne shook his head.  "He's got a computer, and he's trying to teach it to throw parties.</p>
<p>"Each night he feeds in the number of enlisted men, the number of officers and whether any of us have seen live action in the last week.</p>
<p>"It spits out the amount of food, the number of tables and tents, and the size of the alcohol ration per soldier."</p>
<p>"It's supposed to learn?" Palmer guessed.  Byrne nodded and continued.</p>
<p>"At the end of each meal we fill out this anonymous slip, ticking whether we liked the meal or not.  The more people tick yes, the more the computer biases to that solution.</p>
<p>"But," muttered Byrne, "it's shit, and no-one ever ticks that they liked the meal.  So everyone hates Dr. Schmidt."  He nodded towards the empty seat opposite Palmer.  As though summoned by the very act of looking for him, Schmidt appeared, beaming.</p>
<p>"How goes the march of the great American military tonight?" he boomed.</p>
<p>"Hungrily," said Palmer, dryly.</p>
<p>Schmidt spoke to Byrne.  "Please try to explain to him what's going on."  He nodded at nothing, sat down and drew a bottle of black lager from his lab coat, which he was still wearing.</p>
<p>The food was served in due course, and the hall seethed with angry mutters.  Minimum rations turned out to be a single beef steak for each person, burned as hard as nails.  Palmer forewent his plastic spoon and snapped a piece off with his fingers directly.  He manipulated it into his mouth.</p>
<p>"The computer also sets the cooking time," Byrne whispered.  Palmer snorted, then found Dr. Schmidt glowering at him.</p>
<p>"Civilised people use cutlery to eat, Mr Jones."  He pantomimed with his knife and fork.  "Like this."</p>
<p>Palmer swallowed the charred lump of meat and thought as best he could about minimising further damage to his future career.  Playing along, it seemed, would at least prevent further sanctions being placed against him.</p>
<p>"Thank you for the advice, Doctor, " he said.  "What should I do if my plastic spoon can't cut my dinner?"</p>
<p>Dr Schmidt flashed red for a moment; Palmer had laid it on too thick.  Visibly controlling himself he said "Ask him to cut your foo for you," indicating Byrne.</p>
<p>There was a momentary pause as the two adults sat and stared at the psychiatrist, then Byrne leaned over and-</p>
<p>"Make him ask." said Schmidt.</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant Byrne, would you please cut my food for me?  Someone has supplied me only with a plastic spoon."</p>
<p>Byrne nodded gravely.  "I certainly shall be happy to cut your food for you, since it would be impossible for you or anyone to cut it using the plastic spoon someone has supplied you with."</p>
<p>"I didn't know it would be beef," snapped Dr. Schmidt.  "I thought I'd taught it about soup."</p>

TODO: I like the above line very much.  Could we enjoy it more?</p>
<p>TODO: The line below is supposed to be Trudy pushing her boundaries, but it's without context.<br />
---</p>
<p>Palmer was caught between joy at upsetting this turgid fuck, and sadness at his future prospect receding further.  Perhaps institutionalisation wouldn't be so bad.  Hell, perhaps the Maze would just flatten everything.</p>
<p>"Hey, sugar," said Trudy, appearing from behind.  She leaned over him and gave him a full lingering kiss on the lips, then vanished, sashaying in the direction of General Morris.</p>
<p>Byrne was sitting open-mouthed and Dr Schmidt was staring at him, with an expression of pure revulsion.</p>
<p>General Morris lumbered up, the green buttons on his green shirt straining against his chest.</p>
<p>"Schmidt, the men want an explanation.  This is the third day on minimum rations."</p>
<p>"I observe also it is three days since you altered my experiment, General, despite my entreaties."</p>
<p>"Schmidt, your computer was organising mess hall with no food.  We were on the bring of a complete breakdown of military discipline."</p>
<p>"Discipline is not my concern.  Morale is."</p>
<p>Even slouching as he was, General Morris managed to loom.  "Address the men.  Now."</p>
<p>Schmidt puffed himself up to his full extent and made his way to a podium on the edge of the marquee.</p>
<p>The hall fell deathly silent.  Angry murmuring would have been bad enough, thought Palmer, but this was the silence a viper made before it struck.</p>
<p>He crunched on a piece of beef, as loudly as he dared.  "This soup is delicious," he whispered to Rogers, who chuckled quietly.</p>
<p>"Best we slip out," said Byrne quietly.  "This could turn ugly."</p>
<p>---<br />
"Friends," boomed Schmidt.  "Friends, I come before you aware of my shortcomings.  I have been lax in my duty of care to you.</p>
<p>"We, you and I, are equal partners in an endeavour that will revolutionise American morale.  When my artificial brain comes to maturity, it will understand your needs better than any human could."  Schmidt brightened at his own words.</p>
<p>There was a very soft shuffling throughout the crowd, which had the unmistakable affect of a jeer.</p>
<p>"But for now, friends, our mechanical child does not understand humans--"</p>
<p>"Make it a psychiatrist!" shouted a wag, and the crowd audibly jeered along.</p>
<p>----<br />
[TODO - from the perspective of Rogers in the crowd.]<br />
----</p>
<p>----<br />
TODO - remove Rogers from this scene<br />
----</p>
<p>They quietly left and Byrne explained further.  "Not ugly violent, but the general will try to take control of the situation and it makes the men restless to see their commanding officer struggle."</p>
<p>They strolled a way in pleasant silence, broken finally by Rogers.</p>
<p>"Are you retarded or not?"</p>
<p>"Watch your tone, private," growled Byrne.</p>
<p>"Sorry, sir."</p>
<p>"Not," said Palmer.  "I've just..." he thought for a moment. "Lost my grip on things a little.  A lot has happened, very suddenly, and it's going to take me a few days to clear my head."</p>
<p>They continued walking.</p>
<p>"Four days ago I was just expecting another day of lectures.  Now I'm carrying a teddy bear around Iowa."</p>
<p>"We're not in Iowa-" began Rogers.</p>
<p>"Classified," cut in Byrne, quickly.  The three of them smiled, and walked on.</p>
<p>Their meandering through the base had been punctuated only by occasional checkpoints, and they now were somewhere behind the medical unit.</p>
<p>Someone nearby was crying.</p>
<p>"There's only one woman on the base," said Byrne, looking at Palmer.  Rogers nodded and the two of them withdrew a few steps.  They spoke at once.</p>
<p>"We'll be right here."</p>
<p>"Call if you need anything."</p>
<p>[TRIGGER WARNING: DEPICTION OF SELF HARM]</p>
<p>Palmer walked towards the source of the noise, wondering what he'd done to earn this duty.  It was coming from Trudy, of course, but nothing prepared him for the knife in her hands, the slashes on her arms or the blood around her mouth.</p>
<p>----<br />
TODO - slow this scene down.<br />
----</p>
<p>She hadn't noticed him, her eyes fogged over with tears, and she slowly and deliberately sank the blade into her right forearm, dragging it across in a slow, damaging motion.  She raised the fresh wound to her mouth to suck it dry - but then bit, tearing at her skin and making it even harder for to heal.  Her left arm was covered in thick scars.</p>
<p>Palmer said "please stop-"</p>
<p>Her eyes shot up and locked on to him.  He averted his gaze but even so he could make out the expressions on her face: fear, anger, shame.</p>
<p>"Go away!"  She brandished the knife at him, still crouched double on the floor.</p>
<p>"But you've hurt yourself."  Her blue long-sleeved jumped lay off to one side, neatly folded and free from blood.  He couldn't meet her eyes.  What the hell happens now? he thought.</p>
<p>"Go away," she enunciated, and started to cry with painful wracking sobs.</p>
<p>Palmer crouched down next to her and helplessly offered her Jimjim.  She rocked back and forth, ignoring him.</p>
<p>"We should stop that blood," he said.  "Come round to the hospital."</p>
<p>"No!"  She swung her attention back to him.  "If you take me there I'll kill you."</p>
<p>Palmer backed off a little and sat down properly.  "You know, that's not even the first time someone has promised that to me today.  How long have you been here?"  He asked it lightly.  "At Grey Base, I mean."</p>
<p>"Since the start.  Since the very fucking start.  My - m-my..."</p>
<p>Palmer waited, but she had gone back into another world again.  Rogers and Byrne were presumably keeping their distance around the corner; he doubted they could hear their conversation.  He eventually placed Jimjim into her lap, clumsily.</p>
<p>"What /is/ this?" She asked.  "Seriously."</p>
<p>"Something important, to me.  My mother made it for me before she died.  Then, when dad died, it was destroyed in the car crash."  He watched her blood stain the edges of its fur.  "I'm kinda glad to have it back."</p>
<p>"You'll hate it soon," she said.  "You can't tell anyone where you got it, because it's classified, and it will always follow you around no matter what you do to it, even if you destroy it it will come back the next day, and everyone here will think you're a freak."</p>
<p>Palmer nodded his head.</p>
<p>"It's happened to everyone that can see the Maze," she said.</p>
<p>"Tell me about your thing.  The... head."</p>
<p>Trudy looked into the ground.</p>
<p>"It's my ex-boyfriend.  He walked out on me when I told him I was pregnant.  I found his head in the Maze, before I lost the baby."  She glanced at him, then away, quickly.  "Took all my money, too."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry.  Does he know you're carrying a copy of his head around?"</p>
<p>She shrugged.  "No-one's seen him since he walked out on me.  I was already here by then."</p>
<p>Her armed had slowed in its bleeding.  He pointed.  "Can I bandage that?"</p>
<p>"You got bandages?"</p>
<p>"I'll go get some."</p>
<p>The medical bay was silent, but not locked, and the bandages and tools were easy to find.  He returned to find her in the same pose, her eyes closed.  He took her arm in his grasp, and she went slack.</p>
<p>"Would you prefer to do this yourself?"</p>
<p>"What does it matter?"</p>
<p>"I guess... it's your body."</p>
<p>Her blue eyes opened a crack, and glinted in the early evening light.  She leant back against his knees.</p>
<p>"You do it."</p>
<p>He painted it with disinfectant and wound it up as best he could; the knife blade had obviously been clean and sharp.  A cough came from the entrance to the alley, and Trudy straightened up.  It was Byrne.</p>
<p>"People will be coming back this way pretty soon, sir.  Thought y'all would want to know."</p>
<p>They stood, and Trudy had darted to her jumper and slipped it over her head in the time it took Palmer to proffer a hand to do the same.  He doubted Byrne had noticed the state of her arms in the low light.</p>
<p>"I'll see you around."</p>
<p>"Yeah," she said, tiredly.  "You will."</p>
