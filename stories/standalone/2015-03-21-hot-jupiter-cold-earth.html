<p>Walking home from her grandmother's house, Maria trod on a snow-egg.</p>
<p>"Butternutters," she cursed. Thinking to distract her aunt, she said "It's cold today."</p>
<p>"It's Sunday, Maria," replied her aunt. "It's always precisely three degrees colder on a Sunday, because Jupiter passes in front of the Sun and blots out a precisely one percent of the Sunlight."</p>
<p>One percent was French for one hundredth. Maria never understood why grown-ups persisted in speaking French whenever they needed to sound smart. She tried to wipe her boot on the snow as subtly as possible.</p>
<p>"When I was young," Aunt Lina reminisced, "it was always cold on a Monday, but now it's always cold on Sunday." She sighed, not entirely unhappily, and carried on crunching through the snow.</p>
<p>"Tide was high today, too," said Maria, hopping along after her. Snow-eggs had acid that could eat through boots, Jenny at school had said, and these were new boots.</p>
<p>"Tide is always high on Sunday, Maria." Aunt Lina turned to look at her properly and caught her wiping her feet. "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"I trod on an egg," she admitted.</p>
<p>"Oh, Maria! Show me the nest." They walked back to where the nest was, Maria's cheeks burning brightly in the cold air. "Oh, the poor snakes - the town has been getting more and more built up and they don't know where to nest any more." Aunt Lina drew a bright red ribbon out of her pocket, and took the hair chops out of her hair. Planting the hair chops in the snow she wound the bright red ribbon around the damaged nest in a big circle. "There. No-one will step on it now. Come on, Maria - there are two more eggs left. It's not so bad."</p>
<p>Maria wiped her eyes, not willing to admit that she had cried a little at hurting a snowsnake. Everyone knew the snowsnake would hunt you down and bite you if you trod on one of it's eggs, and because they laid their eggs in the fresh snow every Sunday you had to be really careful not to ever walk on fresh snow. Maria didn't say this aloud, because she was old enough to know that grown-ups didn't believe that sort of thing, and she didn't want to be thought of as a child. But she knew that the snowsnake would hunt her down, and she worried a bit that two contradictory things seemed to be true.</p>
