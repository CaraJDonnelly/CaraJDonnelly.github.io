<p><i>“...this one, this one, his skin is so pretty, and his hair so long and red.  I’m watching him right now, right now,” --hiss-- “he’s sitting waiting for his girl to come pick him up, fiddling with his silver ring with the pale thin finger and thumb of his left hand.”</i></p>
<p><i>--click--</i></p>
<p>“Hear that hiss around minute eighteen, Sal?  Could be a train braking.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.  Think he’s near the Overground?  Or somewhere like Finsbury Park?  He’s definitely outside -- can’t be Waterloo.”</p>
<p>“Could be.  Play it back.”</p>
<p><i>--click--</i></p>
<p><i>“--watching him, right now, right now,” --hiss-- “he’s sitting w--”</i></p>
<p><i>--click--</i></p>
<p>“OK.  Train braking, possible, not underground, eighteen minutes twenty-six seconds.  What else do we have so far?”</p>
<p>“In order, from the start: electronic beeping, could be a pedestrian crossing, six minutes eleven seconds.  Phone fumbling, --”</p>
<p>“Skip the exact times.”</p>
<p>“-- eight minutes.   Train braking, eighteen minutes.  Briefcase opening, twenty minutes.  Birdsong, twenty-eight minutes.”</p>
<p>“The briefcase opening could be the train setting off again.”</p>

<p>“His next target, target five, is married or engaged to be married.”</p>
<p>“You sure?  He said ‘ring’, not ‘wedding ring’.”</p>
<p>“Everyone else he’s gone after has been either married or engaged.  I don’t think it’s a leap to say this one’s ring is going to be a wedding ring or engagement ring too.  Your call, boss.”</p>
<p>“Mark it as possible.”</p>
<p>“Yes’m.”</p>
<p>“And target five is left handed.”</p>
<p>“Come on, now, Sal.”</p>

<p><i>“-- of his left hand.  He's squeezing his legs together, and his blue, blue eyes flicker up to the horizon, then back down to his tight, tight legs.  His eyes are so very blue, and he never looks at the strangers passing around.  His skin is so pale and he is so scared of them.  His eyes are so honest.  His tiny ears are so high on his head, like a little rabbit ” --chunk --</i></p>
<p>“There’s the train.”</p>
<p>“Shh.”</p>
<p><i>“-- scared of the darkness outside his hutch.”</i></p>
<p><i>--click--</i></p>
<p>“Changing ‘briefcase opening’ to ‘train starting’, nineteen minutes forty-four seconds.  He mentions other people around, too, so a park is looking good.”</p>
<p>“Sounds good.  Ugh.  I need a break.  Want some coffee?”</p>
<p>“It’s kinda late.”</p>
<p>“He says this guy would be “dead within a week”, and that’s not including the time after he does the kidnapping.  We’ve lots to do before the morning.  Coffee?”</p>
<p>“...Sure.  Want me to make it, Jan?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m good.  Thanks, Sal.”</p>
<p><i>--rustle, hiss--</i></p>

<p>“...Why left-handed, Sal?”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you in a minute.  No, in… twenty-four seconds.”</p>

<p><i>“--scared of the darkness outside of his hutch.  He’ll be my little rabbit soon.  All mine, and no-one else’s.  He’s sipping a little coffee -- oh, his girl has arrived, walking across the grass and waving.  He flutters his hand to wave back, and his tacky silver ring glints in the sunlight.  I’ll cut off his --”</i></p>
<p><i>--click--</i></p>
<p>“Left-handed.”</p>
<p>“How do you figure, Sal?”</p>
<p>“Don’t patronise me, Jan.  He’s sipping a coffee and then he waves at his girl.  His wedding ring --”</p>
<p>“--it’s not a wedding ring--”</p>
<p>“--his <i>wedding ring</i> glints in the sunlight.  His wedding ring is on his right hand.  So he’s waving with his right hand.  So his coffee is in his left hand.  So he’s left handed.  Look, you’re holding your coffee in your right hand right now.”</p>
<p>“He could be ambidextrous.  Or mixed-handed, that’s a thing too.  A different thing, I mean.”</p>
<p>“Left-handed.  I’m putting it down.”</p>
<p>“OK, sounds good.  Just wanted to see if you were confident.”</p>
<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“You don’t have to listen to this bit again.”</p>
<p>“What?  Why not?”</p>
<p>“It’s not … nice.  It’s the sick rantings of a nut.”</p>
<p>“I’ll stay.  It’s my job as much as yours.”</p>
<p>“It might be more helpful if you go up to the Ops Room to give them what we’ve got so far.  Casey and Waleed are trying to narrow down where the call came from.  If you can tell them he recorded it in a park near a above-ground train station that might cut out ten dead ends off the bat.”</p>
<p>“You aren’t trying to shield my green newbie mind from the horrors of real police work?”</p>
<p>“No. But if there’s no point listening to something... there’s no point in listening to it.  Go on. I’ll be up in twenty.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Jan.”</p>
<p>“No problem, Sal.  See you in a bit.  And drink some more coffee.  We’re going to be here all night.”</p>
