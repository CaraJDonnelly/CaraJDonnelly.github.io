<p>The room was crammed.</p>
<p>Not packed with people, Jacqueline Trott, barrister-at-law, observed.  That would imply some kind of tension or anticipation.  This room is <i>crammed</i> with <i>things</i> with walls painted in warm reds and browns.  Trott strode across the green chequered carpet.  Glancing down she could see it had faded with years of beer spilled and steamed out, spilled and steamed out, spilled and steamed out.  She was looking for the best seat in the house, and this was a strange house.</p>
<p>The makeshift theatre was a squat T-shaped room in a working men's club.  At its top was a mantelpiece in the shape of a broad pyramid: eight foot long at its base and five foot high at its apex.  Its levels were topped with donated books, pictures in frames and small tea lights in quiet vases.  Above the middle tiers of the pyramid were two tasteless wood-framed portraits of Winston Churchill.  The sharp frames on the prints and the inlay on the mantle compliment the pyramid shape.  This end of the room was the stage.  Trott stood there and examined the available seats.</p>
<p>Trott always picked the most confident seat first.  First impressions are everything, and nothing creates a worse impression in the mind of a client than standing trying to choose a seat.  Find the most confident seat and sit in it.  If you later decide that confidence is not the best strategy and need to move, that is fine.  There is no confident way to move from a less confident seat to the most confident seat.</p>
<p>There is a bright, good-quality dartboard hidden at the base of one of the arms of the 'T'.  It hung above a red leather couch whose base stuffing has come unstuck so that keys and purses fall down the cushions to be lost in a warm fertile darkness.  The dartboard hangs next to a sash window which is not locked.  She stepped forwards, crossing the corner of the tiny stage, and reclined herself in the corner seat of the red leather couch.  Sitting here they would be invisible from the door, which would be good for a private meeting, and make her seem relaxed.  She took out her work tablet and unlocked the screen, displaying her notes on Teagan Rose.</p>
<p>It is unusual for barristers-at-low to meet their clients directly.  It is even more unusual for a client to request a meeting outside of the office.  Sometimes Trott's clients would claim that they were being followed, and sometimes they would later enter the Witness Protection Programme.  Teagen Rose was head producer at Burro Records and had been charged with punching a guitarist.  Hardly similar.</p>
<p>Her notes stated that Rose had been sweating when they had met in the office last week.  The most confident seat might scare Rose off.  Trott stood and moved to a seat second from the end of the third row.  It was still a confident position and less obtrusive.  The floor clinked beneath her, and she peered down to find two half-full beers abandoned under her seat.  It was a truly artless room, with no guile put into its arrangement.  Trott imagined the decorator murmuring "Well, we're all friends here” and thinking no more about it.</p>
<p>The lights went down and the compères for the evening took the stage. In keeping with the cluttered room there were far too many of them.  Seven in total, they covered the stage from edge to edge.  One of them began speaking about the importance of local community theatre as the others nodded in silent agreement.  Teagan Rose slipped into the seat beside her.</p>
<p>"Thank you for meeting me," she mutters, and Trott nodded slightly.   There had been the smell of whisky on her client’s breath.  Rose looked around the dark room before continuing.  "You remember the name Dax Providence?"</p>
<p>"The guitarist who has been harassing you?" asked Trott, also muttering.  A good barrister never varies from the chosen story.  Rose nodded.</p>
<p>"I found her garotted in her bed this morning.  I haven't told the police.  I didn't kill her, and I know who did."  She lifted a finger to point at the lead compère, who was still speaking about local theatre.  "Her."</p>
