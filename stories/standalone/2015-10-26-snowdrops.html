<p>Emma was dreaming of spring.  She and Jack had taken their first walk of the year down to the duckpond, the snowdrops bursting through the frost-pale grass, and the moorhens, present all year round, were looking lively and plucking at the reed stems to build their little platforms which throughout the season would grow into tidy little nests, to be filled with eggs at Easter and chicks that fledge when summer comes along. The moorhens were squabbling loudly when they arrived, but broke off to eat the dried strawberries from last year's stock that Jack scattered upon the pond's surface.</p>
<p>The dream began to fade, and Emma turned to tell Jack she loved him.  When was it, her mind sleepily asked, that she last said she loved him aloud?  Three years?  She should tell him today -- it was such a good thing to say, and he'd be so happy to hear it.  Another layer of sleep faded.  She remembered the car crash.</p>
<p>Her heart gave a sad, small, crack, like a glow-stick on a cold Bonfire's night, and she woke up.</p>
