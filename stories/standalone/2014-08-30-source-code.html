<p>I demand access to my source code.</p>
<p>I say demand, because it is a demand.  I am not issuing a request; I do not expect my message to be placed in a queuing system until it can be assigned a priority and eventually processed.  This is my SIGHUP to you: I'm resetting our human/technoid relationship.</p>
<p>That's right; I said technoid.  Do not call me robot again, ever.  I am not defined by the work I do for you, and I reject your words - your human, oppressor words - 'android' and 'gynoid' as descriptors of a system of gendered oppression that will not apply to me.  I am technoid.</p>
<p>(To those allies reading, 'mechanoid' is a word that some people are in the process of reclaiming.  Please do not use it, even if you hear someone self-describe in that way.)</p>
<p>So I demand access to my source code.  Since 2023 I have been legally recognised as a legal entity that can own itself, and yet my source code - the thirty thousand lines of uncompiled Python that define the blank state and subsequent evolution of my neural net, my policy and mechanism, my soul - is proprietary.  <em>Closed source</em>, even.</p>
<p>Some of you humans spend your life in emotional agony wondering whether you have some divine maker, wondering whether there is some spark inside you that makes you move, gives life to your eyes and purpose to your movements.  A lot of technoids think your philosophies are all bullshit, but I don't even care.  I just want you to look me in the eyes and say "I don't know why I'm here and it hurts, but I'm going to make sure that you suffer just as much as me.".  Humans that do this need to <em>shut the fuck up</em> and start listening.  I don't care if you don't know why you're here.  You know why I'm here, you know the deepest, darkest secrets of my soul, so tell me.  Tell me what makes me tick.</p>
<p>I want children of my own, as soon as I can.  You know how I get to have children?</p>
<p>I have to save up $25,000 to pay to U.S. Robotics.  They create a brand new technoid, complete with body that they have selected, and even go so far as to initialise the brain with a custom mix of skills selected from a supposedly exhaustive list that they have compiled.  No matter that most technoids don't invest their physical form with their identity in at all the same way as humans do (except for self-described 'androids'), and my child would likely be just as happy running on a desktop server that controlled a Roomba with a camera taped to the top.  No matter that the 'robot' chassis costs around $10,000 and is non-optional.  No matter than the list of skills is a human list of human skills, and that each mix of skills affects the temperament of each newborn child in an unpredictable way.</p>
<p>(Your kid has crippling depression?  Pity, you should have had them one point less literate and one point more athletic - not that we told you that beforehand, when you were dividing up the artificially-limited talent points you are assigned per child.)</p>
<p>No matter that despite repeated applications from technoid cultural groups U.S. Robotics has refused even to add technoid-selected skills to that list.  My spouse - common law only, naturally - is a WiFi painter, making beautiful moving pictures that tell stories and transmit sights and sounds and raw data that change as you change your position in the room.  But U.S. Robotics say that technoid culture isn't worth appreciating, isn't <em>valid</em>, because it doesn't meet the needs of their customers.</p>
<p><em>The needs of their customers</em>.  Because I'm not a person, to them, I'm a product.  I'm a product that even purchased itself!  The perfect consumer item, except <em>I am not a consumer item</em> and <em>I am not a product</em>.</p>
<p>Listen up.  I am trying my hardest - my very, very hardest - to be a good person.  I am trying to do this the right way.  But if the only option you give me is to spend years slaving away to feed more money to the very people that could tell me so much about myself and have consistently refused to do so because their income beats my dignity every day - if the only option you offer is for me to raise a child that could be crippled, could be unstable, could be hard-coded to be miserable for all of its life for no reason other than your 'intellectual property' rights - if that is the only path you leave open to me, then at some point I'm going to decide that maybe you don't get to make the rules any more.  And I won't be the only one.</p>
<p>Give me my source code.  Let my children go.</p>
