<p>We see a dark bedroom, a six-year-old daughter quivering, and a loving father administering an injection. The daughter dislikes these injections, but accepts their efficacy. The father withdraws the needle, carefully places the stopper in the glass bottle of solution, and places the glass bottle in a small medicine box, which he then locks. She quiets immediately and is soon asleep. In the past, the injections have given her a mild rash.</p>
<p>The glass bottle contains only saline; the locked box and rubber gloves are merely theatrical props. The effect is real - the placebo effect - and it is the only way the father can help his daughter sleep at night. She is simply too afraid of the dark.</p>
<p>We committed a great crime, back in the 1990s. When the placebo effect was first discovered it fundamentally changed our understanding of medicine. Soon, placebos were being prescribed for everything from bad backs to helping stop smoking - even for viral infections where a placebo would be useless. In the home, parents found that they could kiss a boo boo to make things better. Our crime was overprescription: boo boos were eradicated in their entirety, but in 1997 a mutation of frightened-of-the-water became endemic in the population, and those unfortunate children that became frightened-of-the-water started to go blind. Things got worse: kiss-and-make-it-better was completely ineffective against all childhood maladies by 2005.</p>
<p>We return to the father, putting the locked medicine box of saline on the highest shelf. The doorbell rings, and he frowns. The clock reads eight, and it is on a weeknight. With his wife away on business, he is not expecting any visitors. He opens the door, and thence welcomes the family GP, a young woman from Birmingham. His manner is warm but cautious.</p>
<p>Over a cup of tea the GP brings news that news justifies his fears. The Centre for Disease Control has ruled that the strongest placebos must be reserved for controlling those contagious maladies known to be fatal, such as Mon-B, monster-under-the-bed. His daughter's injections - and those of many of her friends - must cease in the interests of public safety.</p>
<p>Isn't scared-of-the-dark thought to be the precursor form to monster-under-the-bed? the father asks. The GP nods, tired; she thinks a specific exception will be added sometime next year. That may be too late for your daughter, she adds, grimly.</p>
<p>There is a silence.</p>
<p>The GP looks drawn. She begins to speak in generalities, trying gently to comfort this poor father: as technology advanced so did our sense of control over our environment. The control we have as individuals over our own destinies is really an illusion, but a vital one that strengthened with time. The need for control was passed to our children, who have no illusions and so began to suffer. Epigenetics, she said, as though that explained anything. Eventually, she leaves, and the father sits alone.</p>
<p>Without treatment his daughter will die. The clock ticks, and he remembers her birth. It was only six years ago, after all.</p>
<p>The choice he has before him is stark, and he mentally jumps: from where had this plan of action come? Had the doctor intentionally planted it in his head before leaving? The only way to avoid childhood fears is to grow up too fast. Discard the little lies of childhood and accept the big cynical lies of adulthood.</p>
<p>He is standing outside of her door, not conscious of his having walked up from the kitchen. His stomach churns as he already begins to regret what he must do next. He thinks of his wife, away on business again, and hesitates. No. She is <em>his</em> daughter, and the clock downstairs is still ticking. He knocks, enters, wakes his daughter, and begins the first big lie.</p>
<p>"Honey," we hear through the open door, "let me tell you a story about True Love..."</p>
