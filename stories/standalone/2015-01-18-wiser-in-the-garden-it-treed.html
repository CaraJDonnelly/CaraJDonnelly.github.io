<p><em>This is a story about a tree.  I found it on the back page of a copy of Obelisk Magazine at the bottom of one of my memory boxes; the magazine was solely in black and white with a sugar-paper cover dated March 1941.  The story was attributed to María Lidia Lloveras, with a note stating that she had found it mixed in to a bundle of old account-papers.  The rest of the magazine was written in Arabic; on the inside of the cover, in my old handwriting, was the word 'Ukbara' clearly printed.</em></p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>In the Garden, there are many trees.  They are, as with every tree, composed of a mixture of the base elements.  The tree that this story is about had, as with every tree in the Garden, its own gardener dedicated to its care.</p>
<p>This tree grew poorly from a seed.  Trees in the Garden grow straight and branch out to gather the light of the Sun, but this tree split in twain as a sapling.  One trunk grew straight and tall and branched correctly, but gave no leaves, while the other trunk grew leaves in abundance but dangled downwards, catching no light at all.  The gardener considered, and laid the leafy trunk along the strong trunk.  The tree continued its growth, matching height with those around it.</p>
<p>Some years later, the gardener noted a blue tinge to the surface of the two trunks where they met; at their base where they joined a hard, clear resin had formed, bright ethereal blue.  Quickly it became clear that this resin was in fact the xylem of the tree, expressed not as an internal network of high surface area and low flow rate but growing separate as one unified channel, its simple topology divorced from the other trunks perhaps allowing what must be admitted to be a high rate of flow.</p>
<p>The single xylem carried upwards the nutrients and water intended for the growth of the tree.  The gardener wound it around the strong trunk and the leafy trunk, and it settled well into its task of providing for them, and for binding them together.</p>
<p>The water in the Garden grew foul, as it did every sixteen years.  The strong trunk grew thorns.  All trees in the Garden, of course, have thorns - without them the soft bark is easily scored and damaged and each tree injured - but this trunk grew them only on its upper surfaces, its foul spines ripping into the leafy trunk and threatening even to pierce the xylem.  The tree was dying and was in this phase of growth now stunted compared to its neighbours.</p>
<p>At a loss, the gardener consulted many strange sources, and eventually -- and in the face of some criticism -- uprooted the tree in its entirety, moving it from the West Orchard to the East, where the water became sweet rather than foul each sixteenyear.  The tree survived the move, and the leafy trunk flourished, gathering more light than had ever been possible before.  The gardener found that the spines on the strong trunk were able to be separated, like thick, bladed vines, and so wound them round the base of the tree where they could do no harm.  They stayed there dormant for many years.</p>
<p>The tree grew stronger without the influence of the foul waters of the West Orchard, but was still far from healthy.  Where the other trees were simply that -- trees, as you or I might imagine them, their roots ploughed deep and their branches outstretched to receive the gift of sunshine -- this tree had years of warp and uneven growth that had left its mark upon it.  It grew, though.  There were many seedlings in these Orchards that simply failed to take root and flourish.  The gardener was fortunate that their tree had not simply withered and died.</p>
<p>And there it stands to this day - a visibly uprooted tree in the East Orchard, its branches a tangled mass of hardwood, exposed xylem and over-abundant leaves.  The gardener, after some years, began arranging the xylem and leaf trunks more closely with the strong trunk, and reaffixed the thorn vines to the exterior of the strong trunk, in the hope that the four trunks might grow together as one in each place, as in the healthy trees surrounding it.  They have so begun.</p>
<p>If you would see a long project coming slowly to fruition, go and examine that tree.</p>
