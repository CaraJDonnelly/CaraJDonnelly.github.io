<p><em>I love reading Orwell.  He is remembered for 1984 and Animal Farm, but he was a fantastic observer.  Coming Up For Air and Keep The Aspidistra Flying are both worth reading, and are pleasant to read for the most part; they are not adventures or stories or tragedies, just observations, much like Orwell's eyewitness reports of Burma.</em></p>
<p>The pub was a good idea.  There is motion and sound and humans around me.  Smells, too, the smells of people.  Music.  The barman just nearly dropped a glass and only I saw, and we shared a smile.  I wonder idly whether overeating or overdrinking is worse for you long term, once you factor in the physical and emotional effects.  Overeating is better for you physically, but overdrinking might yield insights and clarity -- the things we don't say to ourselves when we're sober.</p>
<p>Someone ordering food nearby asks if the mussels are good and the barman interrupts eagerly.  "I don't eat seafood, sir, so I couldn't tell you."  He adjust a glass in the dishwasher behind the bar.  "But the feedback's been good."  The barman is a salesman.  Two Pakistani men, newly elderly, come in and ask for two Amstels.  He goes to the tap, then to the cellar but returns empty-handed.  "I'm afraid we're out of Amstel," and he picks up another glass and twirls it expectantly.  "Can I get you both a Heinekin?"</p>
<p>(A nice gent comes up and says I have lovely handwriting.  I show him last week writing with my quill and he said it's like going back in time.  "All freehand," he says, and I smile in pleasure and wonder what he means.)</p>
<p>The barman, dressed in a white shirt with black buttons, has disappeared into the kitchen.  His replacement is a lady who moves more slowly, unhurried and calm, both Caucasian.  "Anything else?" She asks the three men drinking to my right.  "Yep," one answers.  "What would you like?" She asks, and does not repeat herself.  They take a long time to reply.  She is wearing a soft red top, no buttons.</p>
<p>The men complete their food order and she moves off to the till, still calm, still unhurried.  They make a few laddish advances and she turns their words aside with a soft smile.  Her voice sounds more tired when she next speaks and she too disappears, going around a corner to a second bartop, away from the customers, to stack glasses.  Her toil does no harm but is not really necessary yet, it being early in the evening, and so she walks off to gather empties.</p>
<p>The high ceiling is pleasantly gloomy, the lights all hanging low at head height.  Ornaments, deliberately eclectic, adorn the walls in the darkness.  <em>Look</em>, they say, <em>but seek an impression rather than detail</em>.  It is effective.  Three broad pillars break up the space and soften the sounds of conversation.  A picture of the Queen, young and straight-backed, hangs above the till next to the optics which cover the suggestion of a mirror.</p>
<p>It was good to come here.  I may come here again.</p>
