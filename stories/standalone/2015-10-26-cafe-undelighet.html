<p>There's a place in Norway, a restaurant, where you go to show how rich you are to other rich people.  It's not in a city -- the journey there is inconvenient and famously treacharous.  The travel out there is part of showing how rich you are -- that you can spend so much of your time, your valuable time, on something as trivial as a single meal.  To fly to Bergen, to take a helicopter to Svalbard, to travel by sled the final fifty miles to Cafe Undelighet.</p>
<p>Around once a year the very rich and well-connected can pay to enter a drawing of lots at this restaurant.  The loser spends the next twenty-four hours however they wish -- within reason, and wearing a radio collar -- and are then cooked and eaten.  Their death is quietly attributed to a sledding accident.</p>
<p>Last year the loser was a volunteer, a water speculator from Mexico who had made his first fortune in Brazil.  He was a vegetarian, and so spent his final night hungry -- the lodge only serving traditional expensive dishes that involved meat -- drinking oak-aged aquavit interspersed with sips of dark beer.  No-one asked why he had decided to die this way -- aside from to check quietly with the organisers that it wasn't some gross sexual thing, of course.  Other people's problems were other people's problems.</p>
<p>Pity about the volunteering, though -- sort of dampened the excitement that year.  This year was better.  New grandfather.</p>
