<p>The first paper of Alexis Chang was well received: high-quality simulations of common toxins that were <em>extremely</em> well correlated to increased risk of cancer, with demonstrations of possible pathways for the cancer to initially develop.</p>
<p>The <em>second</em> paper of Alexis Chang caused a stir: a zero-day exploit in the Sunroof operating system that allowed an attacked to gain control by injecting content into video streams.</p>
<p>The <em>third</em> paper of Alexis Chang was a humdinger: she revealed that the simulations for the first paper had been run on the Dark Cloud, a distributed computing network built from personal machines that had been hacked using the exploit in the ubiquitous Sunroof operating system.  It included prices and detailed instructions on how to become a customer, and academics from the poorer universities quietly began investigating the Dark Cloud as a possible cheap way to run simulations they had previously been unable to because of funding cuts.</p>
<p>The <em>fourth</em> paper was about how to publish a paper whilst avoiding the back-and-forth communication between the author, editor and referees being used by the authorities to track you down.  The police, who were trying to use the back-and-forth communication between the author, editor and referees to track down the author, were not happy when they got the joke.</p>
<p>Then she bought the Royal Mail, and declared that rather than obeying <a href="http://bravenewgeek.com/you-cannot-have-exactly-once-delivery/"><em>at most once</em> <em>delivery</em></a> they would start obeying <em>at least once delivery</em>, which, after some hesitation and some discussion in the newspapers, was broadly agreed to be a Good Thing, especially since the conditions for more-than-once delivery required the Royal Mail to suffer from a split-brain, which was widely agreed to be impossible.</p>
<p>Then Scotland left the Union.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Derek Roddins lived in Berwick-on-Tweed, and was not happy.</p>
<p>"I paid this!" He shouted at the postman wearing the livery of Royal Mail Scotland, waving the phone bill he had just opened.  "I paid this last week!"</p>
<p>He stomped inside and stopped short.</p>
<p>"Who the hell are you?" He snapped at the tall woman with Asiatic features sat in his red comfy chair.  "Piss off."</p>
<p>"I," the woman intoned, "am Alexis Chang."</p>
<p>"I don't care.  Piss off."  He walked over to the sideboard and poured himself a Scotch.  "Piss off out my house."</p>
<p>"I sent you a package, Mr Roddins," she said, "and I have come to collect them."</p>
<p>"Piss off."</p>
<p>"I'll pay your phone bill."</p>
<p>Derek Roddins looked up, at that.  "Is this your fault?" He asked, waving the phone bill in question.  "I paid this last week."</p>
<p>"It is, Mr Roddins," she said, dipping her head graciously.  "I do apologise for the inconvenience."  She stood, and Derek saw the hole in her leg, dark dried blood surrounded by fresh soaking through her grey trouser leg.</p>
<p>"You're bleeding," he said, stupidly.</p>
<p>"They're here," she replied, limping quickly past him to the front door, where Derek heard four knocks, in two groups of two.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Alexis Chang opened the well-painted red front door of the small house in Berwick-on-Tweed, and smiled brightly at the two male couriers.  "Good morning," she said.  "Lovely day."</p>
<p>"Alexis-" one began, the one wearing Scottish Royal Mail livery.</p>
<p>"Alexis-" the other began, the one wearing UK Royal Mail livery.</p>
<p>"- Chang?" The first finished.</p>
<p>"Yes, that's -" she began.</p>
<p>"-Chang?" The second finished.</p>
<p>"-me.  Yes, that's -" she finished and began.</p>
<p>"Great. I have -" the first began.</p>
<p>"-me," she finished.</p>
<p>"Great.  I -" the second began.</p>
<p>"-a delivery for-"</p>
<p>"-have-"</p>
<p>"-you.  Sign <em>here</em>." The first courier proffered a small digital screen and stylus.</p>
<p>"OK, thank-" she begin replying to the first.</p>
<p>"-a delivery for-" the second continued, the stream of words issuing from his lips.</p>
<p>"-you." She finished, replying to the first, and begin signing <em>there.</em></p>
<p>"-you.  Sign <em>here</em>." finished the second.</p>
<p>"OK, thank you." She finished signing there for the first courier, the one in Scottish Royal Mail livery, and signed <em>there</em> for the second courier, the one in UK Royal Mail livery.</p>
<p>The couriers nodded, and each walked to their own vans, returning with a pet carry-case each.</p>
<p>"Come on," she said to Mr Roddins, "grab one and we'll let them out in the living room."</p>
<p>"What's in them?  Why are you bleeding?  Who shot you?"</p>
<p>"Cats."  Alexis Chang thought for a second, and then added "I think.  No more than two cats.  And no less than no cats."</p>
<p>She carefully placed her carry-case on the ground, and sank gratefully back into the comfy chair in the living room.  The police officer in Belgravia had been a good shot, but she couldn't have risked not being here to take delivery of her packages.  She lent forwards and started to undo the clips on the front of the first case.</p>
<p>"Careful," she said to Mr Roddins, "they might be radioactive."</p>
<p>"I want you out of my house," said Derek Roddins.  "I don't know who you are or why you've shipped yourself two cats at my address, or why you've been shot, but I want you gone.  This is Berwick-on-Tweed, not <em>The Wire</em>."</p>
<p>Alexis Chang looked up at Derek Roddins. He seemed ordinary enough -- lived alone at 45, but the house was clean and comfortable, and there were poker chips and cards on a sideboard that made it pretty clear that he had what looked, from an outside view, to be a healthy social life.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," she said, "I really am.  And after I'm gone the police will come and ask you questions about why I was here.  So I'll tell you, so you can tell them: you live right on the political line between Edinburgh and Ashington, the two closest Royal Mail sorting offices.  And I didn't send myself two cats at your address --" she popped open the second cage "-- I sent myself the same cat, twice.  Schroedinger's cat.  After the Royal Mail split in two today, it was sent once from Edinburgh, and once from Ashington."</p>
<p>Alexis Chang regretted, later, that she had taken that moment to look up at Derek Roddin's face to see what effect her words were having on him.  This meant she missed the first sight of her new cat, Wigner.  But judging from Roddin's face, he thought Wigner was beautiful and terrifying.</p>
<p>She looked down.  There were two cats sat in front of her, one pure black with one green eye and one blue eye, one pure white with one blue eye and one green eye.  Both were translucent, and both were staring at her expectantly.</p>
<p>"Cyanide," she muttered, recalling her plan, and reached quickly into both pet carriers to turn a small switch that would turn off the radioactive sensor that could have (perhaps already had, in transit) release a small amount of cyanide that would have killed a non-quantum-entangled cat.</p>
<p>"I can see through them cats." Derek Roddins said.  He looked slightly unsteady on his feet.  "Are they ghosts?"</p>
<p>"No," she replied, then, "Maybe.  I've never seen a ghost."</p>
<p>She felt lightheaded.  Wigner was alive, clearly, but was no longer her old grey cat with bluey-green eyes.  She remembered what her old dad had said:</p>
<p><em>"The plan aint done until you've scarpered."</em></p>
<p>and hoisted herself to her feet once more, her arms taking most of her weight as she leant on the wall.  Turning, she addressed Derek Roddins for the last time.</p>
<p>"I've left a bunch of cash in unmarked bills in a suitcase in your front room, that the police are going to take away.  So I've left some cash in your bank account too that they probably won't notice, to cover the double phone bills and so on.  Sorry for the fuss."  She opened the front door and kissed her teeth.  "Wigner!"</p>
<p>Her cat(s) trotted down the hall and followed her out the red front door into the sunshine of Berwick-on-Tweed.</p>
<p>"Right," she said to the world at large, and her quantum-entangled, possibly immortal cat(s).  "I think I'd better find a hospital."  Her stomach rumbled.  "Then some fish"</p>
