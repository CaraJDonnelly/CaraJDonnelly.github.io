<p>Douglas Kutcher stands, and starts to walk toward the airplane toilets. The ranked people around him sat silently under their headphones, every person staring at a movie about individual freedom. The hum of the aircraft is mixed only with the soft squeaks of the drinks trolley and the slow, rhythmic chunk-chunk of the airplane toilets locking and unlocking.</p>
<p>Chunk-chunk. Chunk-chunk.</p>
<p>Douglas squeezes past two businessmen walking past to their seats. We'll follow them for a few sentences.</p>
<p>"It's good to stretch your legs," says one, quietly, and then walks into the back of the other, who has suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>"Gus, I'm dissatisfied with life," whispers the stopped businessman - although, for clarity, we should note that they have both now stopped in the sense of perambulation, and that neither has stopped in the sense of travelling at 500 miles per hour in an airplane. "There's not enough spontaneity."</p>
<p>"What do you mean, Gus?" Asks the non-stopped businessman, who was also called Gus. Their names do not feature heavily in their lives or this story.</p>
<p>"I want to do something spontaneous. Something new. Look, that person's sitting alone - I'm going to use a felt-tip to paint a false moustache on their face."</p>
<p>Gus did so, whilst Gus watched. They continued on their way.</p>
<p>Douglas, meanwhile, has done his business in the toilets and is slouching along behind a squeaking drinks trolley that lies between him and his seat. Douglas usually works in an office, and is travelling to a business meeting at which he will contribute nothing. He is dissatisfied with life; he would like to do something spontaneous and new; he decides, firmly, to express his individuality by painting a false moustache on the sleeping stranger in the seat next to his.</p>
<p>He is saddened to find that the stranger in the seat next to his is already sporting a brand-new false moustache. Aggrieved, he shakes the strange man awake.</p>
<p>"Hey, hey!" The man, also named Gus (no relation), shouts. "What do you think you're doing?"</p>
<p>"Me? What do you think that you're doing?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Where did you get that moustache?"</p>
<p>"What? What moustache? Help!"</p>
<p>"What's going on here?" The Air Marshall asks. He has appeared out of nowhere; in the hum of the aircraft you imagine that the pistol he is holding would be capable of making a very loud and dramatic click.</p>
<p>The hum remains at a constant level; the people around are staring passively at a comedy about love. Gus (no relation) blurts</p>
<p>"This man attacked me-"</p>
<p>-but Douglas speaks as well-</p>
<p>"This man attacked me with his moustache."</p>
<p>"With his moustache? How?"</p>
<p>"I am dissatisfied with life."</p>
<p>The Air Marshall, ever alert for any hint of crime, broods. "Go on."</p>
<p>"Well-"</p>
<p>Gus (no relation) interrupts. "I don't have a moustache!" he cried. Douglas and the Air Marshall regarded his large paint moustache.</p>
<p>"You see," said Douglas, "he's already lying."</p>
<p>"I do see," saw the Air Marshall.</p>
<p>"I am dissatisfied with life," Douglas continued, "and I wished to paint a false moustache on this man. But when I attempted to do so I found that he already had a moustache."</p>
<p>"I do /not/ have a moustache," said Gus, feeling his paint moustache.</p>
<p>"You do," retorted Douglas, "and so prevented me from being satisfied with life. Air Marshall, this man attacked me emotionally."</p>
<p>"Well," broods the Air Marshall, "attacking someone on a plane is an act of terrorism."</p>
<p>Into the silent hum comes a loud and dramatic click. The Air Marshall has raised his gun and is pointing it at Gus.</p>
<p>"No!" Cries Douglas. "No, no, no! You can't kill this man because I couldn't paint a false moustache on him."</p>
<p>There comes a second click, and the Air Marshall has raised a second gun to point at Douglas.</p>
<p>"Telling an Air Marshall what to do is also an act of terrorism."</p>
<p>Chunk-chunk, went the ordinary people. Chunk-chunk.</p>
<p>"Look," said Douglas, "why don't we just wash this false moustache off this strange man and forget that this ever happened?"</p>
<p>"Wash the moustache off?" Asked the Air Marshall.</p>
<p>"Yes," chorused Douglas and Gus.</p>
<p>"That," growled the Air Marshall, "would be destroying evidence of an act of terrorism. That would be -"</p>
<p>"An act of terrorism?" squeaked Douglas and Gus.</p>
<p>"Yup."</p>
<p>"You can't shoot us - that would be a crime!" Gus wailed.</p>
<p>"No, it wouldn't - besides, I'm an Air Marshall. Not a single one of us has ever been even charged with a crime."</p>
<p>"No?" Asked Douglas, curious even in front of a gun barrel.</p>
<p>"Of course not. It's an act of terrorism to accuse an Air Marshall of a crime."</p>
<p>Chunk-chunk, chunk-chunk, pissed the ordinary people. Chunk-chunk. Chunk-chunk.</p>
