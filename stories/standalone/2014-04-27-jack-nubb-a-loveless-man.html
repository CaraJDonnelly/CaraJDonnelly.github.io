<p><em>(genre: pulp noir)</em></p>
<p>Twenty-one years later, Jack Nubb was standing in the rain outside what he suspected was the suicide compound.</p>
<p>The alien plague had struck, and made love a transitive relationship. That means if Alice loves Bob, Bob loves Alice, and if Bob loves Clive, Alice loves Clive. Of course, everyone loves themselves a little bit too. Everyone except Jack Nubb. Triples were most common, followed by quartets. Crime dropped as family units became stable, and even war became less likely. Solos were freaks.</p>
<p>He had been a journalist when the plague came, and most people thought that had made him too isolated to get infected. They were wrong. He had always simply hated himself.</p>
<p>Jack hated the new society that had grown up around it, too, and followed the only path left open to him: a lone private investigator. No case too dangerous. Ten years in the business, then this case had been thrown to him by the Feds; a lovebubble, an unusually large group of people all verifiably in love with one another, had developed in upstate New York. His job: find out why.</p>
<p>No one trusts a PI, and no one likes a Solo. He had needed to find cover.</p>
<p>Marlene Johnson and Rudy Johnson were everyday losers, and needed cash. Not too bright and not too interested in sex. Jack had sailed in to their lives, played a sob story about a quintet gone unstable and smoothly lied his way in. Don't blame Marlene and Rudy; you'd think you were falling in love with someone with a silver tongue who was dragging you out of penury too. Six months later, they moved to the town near the lovebubble camp. They were the type: everyday losers. They got snapped up.</p>
<p>After the plague hit a lot of work had been done on the chemical causes of love. Some billionaires disliked finding that they, through their spouses, now loved their pool attendants, and ways to test and block love were developed. So were ways to fake it, and Jack was a master of faking it. All illegal, but that was why the Feds had had to come to him in the first place. He smelt corruption at the first meal in the camp; smelled it like the bromide in the food. He smiled sweetly at the Marleywoods, the triple assigned to welcome them, and mentally prepared his escape routes. On a hunch, he stopped taking his fake love supplements after a month in the camp, and found the chemical levels in his blood kept rising. This lovebubble was artificial, and he was being forced - drugged - to fall in love. He had to act fast.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Jack Nubb, in all his life, had only seen three things motivate people: money, power, or religion. Money was easy - you found the loot. Power was easy too - you stayed the hell out of the way. Religion was hard. This looked like religion.</p>
<p>Dane Black was religious, and known for it. He wrote tracts that he published himself about how the plague was not alien but Holy in origin, as well as owned the camp. He maintained that the world died that day, the day the plague came, and all we had around us was the fading illusions of our memories as we were gathered to God. His own wife had left him, probably because he was nuts.</p>
<p>Jack hadn't seen the Marleywoods around recently either. The camp was big and busy enough that a regular joe wouldn't notice, but a private eye isn't a regular joe. They had moved in to Amethyst block a few weeks back and hadn't come back out.</p>
<p>So, twenty-one years after the love plague struck, Jack Nubb found himself standing in the rain in the dead of night, outside what he strongly suspected was the suicide compound of Dane Black's lovebubble cult. Amethyst block.</p>
<p>A few lockpicks later and Jack stood in a low corridor, same as the other buildings. The rooms here had names on and he expected they would be occupied by still-living converts. He moved on to the upper floor. No names on doors here, but rather locks. The first room revealed a simple nurse's office, the room next door an automated blood analysis machine. Looking closer, he say the machine had been jerry-rigged to register only the highest levels of love chemicals; a nearby handbook gave blood concentrations with names like "acolyte", "devotee" and "prepared". The preface laid it out: we must kill ourselves to be free.</p>
<p>This was enough to earn the Fed's dollar. He hoofed it back to Clover block and readied his escape. Jack Nubb never packed more than a Smith and Wesson revolver and the evidence that would earn him his fee, and that meant clearing his tracks. He dumped his lockpicks and necked the remaining love supplements, then stowed his holster and revolver in his leather grab-bag. He stood and, silently wishing goodbye to Marlene and Rudy, turned to leave.</p>
<p>The brilliant light and the cock of a hammer blinded him and had him reaching fruitlessly to his hip; his revolver safely being stowed in his grab-bag saved his life.</p>
<p>"Good evening, Mr Johnson," said Dane Black from the doorway, revolver in hand, "and, if I might say, what a curious evening to pick for a midnight stroll." Marlene and Rudy sat up, blinking.</p>
<p>"What's going on, Jack?" Asked Marlene.</p>
<p>Two goons squeezed past the muscular frame of Dane Black. "Search the room," he said, and gestured at Jack with his revolver. They proceeded through the rain back to Amethyst block, then to the nurse's station on the upper floor.</p>
<p>"Make no mistake, Mr Johnson, I intend to kill you," said Dane Black, "but first I wish to know how you escaped detection for so long."</p>
<p>Jack thought fast.</p>
<p>"Evaded detection?" He asked, voice quavering, "what do you mean?</p>
<p>"Come, Mr Johnson," said Black, opening Jack's grab-bag and throwing the blood analysis handbook on to the counter. "Please don't play dumb."</p>
<p>Jack thought of the saddest thing he could think of: humanity. He even managed a few tears.</p>
<p>"Dane?" He said, his voice now cracking, "it is you, isn't it? What's going on?" Jack saw the tiniest seed of doubt in Black's eyes, and plowed on. "I came to see if you were here..."</p>
<p>The camp was loaded with images of Dane Black's face. If everyone loves everyone else, and anyone loves Dane Black, everybody loves Dane Black. The seed of doubt blossomed. Dane Black picked up a telephone and spoke in to it, the gun never wavering. Soon a goon arrived and was busy taking Jack's blood. He silently prayed that his love supplements were as fast acting as advertised. The goon shook a discoloured test tube, checked the result against the book, and conferred with Black. The murmurs came "...rare but possible...", "...part of a quintet..." "...with them for almost a year...".</p>
<p>All the while Jack kept his baby-blue eyes wide and confused. Eventually Dane Black hesitated, put down the revolver, and put his arm around Jack in a comforting way.</p>
<p>"Jack - it is Jack, isn't it? I wonder if you could tell me what you are feeling right now."</p>
<p>"I love you," Jack replied unhesitatingly, "and I know you love me. I don't know what's going on but I trust you."</p>
<p>Dane Black sighed and nodded in a fatherly way. "Why did you take the handbook?"</p>
<p>"To read. I wanted to... understand you."</p>
<p>Dane Black's brown eyes started thoughtfully into Jack's blues. "You know my beliefs."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"You trust me."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"You are prepared?"</p>
<p>Jack knew the correct answer. "Yes."</p>
<p>Dane Black turned abruptly to the goon. "Leave us!" He barked. "See that we are not disturbed."</p>
<p>Alone, they walked down the corridor to the room at the end, which Dane Black unlocked and relocked again behind them. The room was comfortable but not excessive. There was a single bed, two wooden chairs, a sink with mirror, a window, a telephone and a refridgerator. Dane Black, his gun holstered, was getting out a bottle of red wine and two tiny wine glasses. He poured them both a measure and carefully handed one to Jack. Jack, unarmed, sat himself in a wooden chair, and Dane Black took the other. Jack waited.</p>
<p>"May I ask you a question, Jack?"</p>
<p>"Of course, Dane," said Jack, putting as much warmth in his voice as possible.</p>
<p>Dane leant forward and stared again in to JAck's eyes.</p>
<p>"What does love feel like? To you?"</p>
<p>At that moment, Jack Nubb realised two things. One, that Dane Black was not just nuts but certifiably Insane, with a capital Eye. Two, he was a Solo.</p>
<p>Dane was still staring beseechingly. Jack had never met another Solo before. With difficulty he recalled his ex-wife's words on the subject.</p>
<p>"Love isn't a job, or something you provide for something. It's a part of you that you feel inside, like a hot coal," and then she had added "and it's something you don't have."</p>
<p>Jack hadn't meant to say the whole thing, and now Dane looked like he had been stabbed right in the heart. There was something wrong with his head. Dane was speaking.</p>
<p>"When the plague came... I was immune. Nina left me. I have tried so many things."</p>
<p>Jack stood and put a hand on Dane's shoulder, part to stop the room spinning and part to comfort a fellow human being. His tongue felt thick.</p>
<p>Six months of mind altering narcotics followed by an unwise overdose can do funny things to a man's head.</p>
<p>"...So many, many things. Never have a felt a single thing!" Dane's sob had turned to a roar as he lurched to his feet, knocking over his chair and pointing his gun accusingly at Jack Nubb.</p>
<p>Jack's head remained wooly but his guts turned to ice as he remembered what this room was for. Dane Black caught sight of the fear in his face and quietened immediately.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Jack , I'm sorry. We'll do it with poison."</p>
<p>Dane stepped towards the refridgerator and stumbled, distracted by his emotions. Jack Nubb stepped forwards, his left hand proffered to give aid, and socked Dane Black in the jaw as hard as he could with his right. Black fell backwards on to the sink and Nubb made a grab at his holster. Black twisted away and tore the mirror off the wall, swinging it in a vicious arc. Jack ducked under and punched one, two, three times.</p>
<p>Five minutes later Dane awoke to find a gun at his temples and Nubb on the telephone.</p>
<p>"...wacko suicide cult. You're outside now? Good. Come get me. Expect resistance." He hung up, and looked at Dane. "Feds'll be here in two minutes."</p>
<p>"Please, Jack, please. Let me run - to try to escape."</p>
<p>Jack Nubb blinked. The sun was rising outside and he suddenly understood the kind of life he wanted to lead. He took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"OK."</p>
<p>Dane did not wait but stood and ran to the door. Jack calmly planted two slugs in his back. Some seconds later, a Fed burst in.</p>
<p>"What the hell was that?"</p>
<p>Jack gestured at the body.</p>
<p>"He ran, and tried to escape."</p>
<p>Jack Nubb tossed Black's gun down and stretched in the sunlight.</p>
<p>He had just earned one hell of a fee.</p>
