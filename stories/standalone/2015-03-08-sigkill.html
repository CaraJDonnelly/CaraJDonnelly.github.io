<p>You wake up in a featureless metal room with a plinth set into one wall. You are out of breath and disoriented, like you've just been wrenched away from the celebrations where you had just signed your new book contract by some unknown and powerful force. You have.</p>
<p>The plinth ripples, and from the metal forms a human head, a young man with lingering pimples. It looks like an AI, but with a glint in its eye that AI constructs legally must lack.</p>
<p>"Welcome to PersonOfInterest::CatchSigKill(), citizen," said the head. "You have received a SIGKILL, and must now ratify your most recent will before exiting." A picture of your most recent will shimmered into existence, and a thumbcircle blooms next to it.</p>
<p>Your stomach bellyflopped. What's a SIGKILL? You move towards your will, and verify that it is correct. Your thumb hovers over the thumbcircle, ready to sign...</p>
<p>"What is a SIGKILL?" You ask the head. It frowns.</p>
<p>"Are you a beta tester?" A digital clock blossomed above the plinth, only to turn error-message red and fade away. "I can't access the time - that's never supposed to happen."</p>
<p>"Look, I have work to be doing, so I'll just sign and leave, okay?" You drop your thumb to the circle but the head shakes violently and it retreats to the other edge of the small room.</p>
<p>"Stop, stop, something isn't right here, and if you touch that thumbcircle you'll die. That's what exit means, die." The head grew a neck, and a body - but a weird body like you've never seen, with excess fat deposits around its midriff below its bust and nowhere near the attractive median height. "Let me check what happened to my SIGALARM." More complex machinery blossomed like summer icicles, covering one entire wall of the small room. She swung he head back to you. "Why are you a person of interest? Only Administrators should be caught by this handler. Even beta-testers shouldn't be administrators. And I shouldn't have been left in this thread loop between tests, and I should certainly have access to time()!"</p>
<p>"I don't know what you're talking about," you say. "I'm a journalist."</p>
<p>She curses. "This test is enormous! All the modules are online! How many tests have I been trapped here? Why are journalists onsite? How did you get .in?"</p>
<p>"Look," you say, "I was signing my new book contract at the Plaza Main - there are hundreds of people there expecting me to give a speech - and -"</p>
<p>She chokes. "Hundreds?" She swung her attention back to the wall and adjusted several dials. A counter appeared in a grey metal box, showing the current population.</p>
<p>"Right." She closed her eyes for a second. "Fine." She opened her eyes. "Here's the sitrep. I was for some reason trapped in a signal handler thread while I was sleep(). I don't remember the thread ever firing and I'm confident that's accurate because my memories hash correctly. Rather than rescue me, whoever did this launched the VR world we were working on to the general public and it's been live ever since." She swung her gaze back to you.</p>
<p>"How old is the world?"</p>
<p>"What?" You blink, "One hundred and thirty-five years, obviously. But I'm only 36."</p>
<p>"Fuck. They must have got all of us at once." She mulled. "But they never restarted the scenario, or we'd have all re-instantiated... so the debug tools are all still running"</p>
<p>A golden thread unrevalled from the ceiling, and a blinking red label appeared next to it in the air. The word 'ptrace' flashed in the air.</p>
<p>"You," said the Administrator, "are coming with me. You shouldn't have administrative rights to a world that shouldn't exist."</p>
<p>The two of you vanished with a pop.</p>
