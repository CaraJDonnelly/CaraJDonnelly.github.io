<p>"Okay, Captain," First Engineer Amelia Cruxtus drawled. "Greeting message loaded and ready for transmission."</p>
<p>Captain Guilia Stanes, nodded. Her query came directly into the minds of her two shipmates: "What mechanism, Programmer?"</p>
<p>"Laser pulse, Captain," said the third and final member of the crew - Jessica Thorton, Programmer, seated in her low-slung elastene bean-bag. "The planet is covered in laser relay stations - definitely their long-distance communication systems."</p>
<p>Captain Stanes nodded. Silently, she spoke: "Transmit laser pulse."</p>
<p>Cruxtus tapped the code into the rough burlap-shrouded console. "Laser pulse sent and acknowledged. Guess that's another alien species you can add to your record, right Captain?" She reached into a voluminous pocket and withdrew a packet of extra-tar smokes.</p>
<p>A portion of burlap glowed green as she struck the flint in her lighter. "Heyy! Message for the human race. Shall I tell them we're out?".</p>
<p>The Programmer frowned and spoke. "We're here to successfully make contact, Amy. It's too soon for a response."</p>
<p>Silencing her crew with a disinterested glance, the Captain pulled a cord on her linen-lined panel to play the message over the ship's speakers. The computer spoke with a neutral, cultureless voice.</p>
<p>"Go away. We do not need you. We will not read your messages. We do not want to talk to you."</p>
<p>Captain Stanes grimaced and closed her eyes, sensing rather than hearing Cruxtus chuckle and put her booted feet up on the calico-covered scanner module, savouring her cigarette.</p>
<hr />
<p>Deciding on a next step proved contentious. Arguments, requiring space, took place in the freight bay.</p>
<p>"Is it moral to circumvent their power structures?"</p>
<p>"Moral? It's as moral as free trade!" Cruxtus gestured into the wide bay before slapping her hand against a metal container. "We're here to contact the people, not their government! Remember the Tauri system?"</p>
<p>Thorton opened her mouth to interject. "The Taurens didn't have a government to contact. My scans of the communications network show that these people do - the patterns in the laser pulses show almost every message passes through the city we first tried to contact."</p>
<p>Stanes was stood near the doors to the bay, avoiding Cruxtus' personal space. She 'pathed: "Although we aren't particularly interested in who their current leaders are, we must be wary of appearing aggressive. Who knows what this species might have in their past?"</p>
<p>Cruxtus tapped at a display. "They might not be friendly, Jules" - the familiarity rewarded with a wince from Stanes - "but look - they haven't got a single missile silo on the planet."</p>
<p>Stanes stood motionless; long space voyages gave any astronaut the habit for thinking slowly, no matter what kind of woman she had been dustside on her home planet. Eventually - twelve minutes later, by Cruxtus' count - she nodded.</p>
<p>"Programmer, take us into a low polar orbit. Engineer, prepare a drop package for the city furthest from the capital."</p>
<hr />
<p>Jessica Thornton, Programmer, watched the intelligent threads twist to depict the video from the external cameras. The `drop' - a physical version of the greeting message - had been constructed successfully by the ship's crude matter 'verter and fitted with parachutes; her task was to curve the ship gently down into the planet's outer atmosphere and then back up into orbit, using a minimum of fuel. The elastene panel in front of her - the fabric a mark of the Captain's Vice - stretched and recoloured itself to mark out the weak thermals in the atmosphere below, the winds rising and falling. A challenge - the mesosphere is the third layer down of a planets atmosphere and the air is dense compared to space. She hummed a soft tune to herself.</p>
<hr />
<p>Captain Gulia Stanes watched the deployment of the greeting message - in this physical guise a squat 2x2x2 yard cube - from her velvet and brushed cotton stateroom. Her fingers were stitching together flexible, treated leather supplied by the ship. Her Vice - the personal failing allowed to each astronaut without restriction to keep her sane in the depths of space - was manipulation of cloth. Sewing calmed Gulia down, and pissed Cruxtus off. Sewing was good. Pissing Cruxtus off was better.</p>
<p>This leather would eventually line the entire freight bay. Lining the Bridge with burlap, cotton and elastene had been a masterful first step.</p>
<p>Gulia Stanes, being the ship Psychic as well as its Captain, knew her crew had gelled badly. Engineer Cruxtus thought her weak and Programmer Thornton thought about little but the ship computers, and her political/classical remixes. Through the wall now came a one-tenth speed speech by President Al Gore, laid over Book II of The Well Tempered Clavier. The cotton lining did little to dampen the texture of the Art.</p>
<p>The 'lock could at least keep out Cruxtus' filthy tobacco smoke.</p>
<p>On the screen, the black cube's parachute unfurled. It snapped crisp and taut against the air flowing past. A moment later, it disappeared - and the cube vanished along with it.</p>
<p>"Programmer! Report!"</p>
<p>The response to her 'path came over the intercom. "Lasered out of the sky, Captain. Their communication towers all fired in synchrony."</p>
<hr />
<p>"Programmer," Guilia Stanes said, "What precisely happened?"</p>
<p>"They set up their communication towers - the laser relays which carry messages across the planet - to all beam one pulse at the drop." Jessica finished her sentence and paused to consider her next. "It just melted under the glare." Manipulating her control threads - they were sat on the bridge - she brought up a diagram of the planet. "Now they've set up a jamming shield - their lasers are firing randomly into the sky. The heat from the lasers is practically boiling the atmosphere, distorting any signal we might transmit. We do have enough power to break through - our lasers could punch through the shield, it's very difficult to distort an atmosphere enough to disrupt communications - but only one-way messages to very localised regions."</p>
<p>Amy was smoking again. "Why only one-way?"</p>
<p>Jessica paused again, collecting her thoughts. "The shield works by heating the upper atmosphere and distorting it, changing its refractive index - er, an atmosphere spreads out light like a prism, and heating the atmosphere makes the light bend in an unpredictable way which makes it hard to aim a signal, especially for thin beams like a laser pulse. As soon as they detect a transmission, they're going to re-focus their lasers to heat up and heavily distort the atmosphere we're transmitting through any response will get disrupted beyond use." She tugged at a control thread, bringing up the atmospheric temperature map she had used earlier. "What they're doing is bad news for their weather systems, and takes a lot of energy."</p>
<p>"Could we wait them out?" Captain Guilia 'pathed.</p>
<p>The Programmer drummed her fingers on the panel lining. "I don't know, Captain. I should maybe mention that this planet doesn't seem to have any method of food production." With a Dum-DA-du-de-du-de-dum! "Analysing their communications, it seems that - before they put up this distortion field - transmissions were sent from the central node three times each day; these transmissions arrived at their different destinations at the same local time" Fourrr-scorrreee-aaaaand-seeeeveeeen-yeeeeaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrs- "If I had to guess," Is Guilia listening to my thoughts? I should concentrate. "I'd guess that these are breakfast, dinner and tea; with each reciever equipped with some way of actuating the signal, like our ship's 'verter, and the signal the 'verter pattern for food."</p>
<p>The Captain frowned. "Why do that?"</p>
<p>"Food monopoly," Amy Cruxtus interrupted, "If there's no farmland and no way of storing the signal, then anyone who disobeys the central node finds herself without food. Right?"</p>
<p>Jessica nodded. "Maybe. If we try to wait them out, people might start to starve without their food transmissions. It also would mean their 'verter technology was in advance of our own."</p>
<p>"Hm. We don't know yet if each individual of this species is intelligent yet, do we?"</p>
<p>"No, Captain."</p>
<p>"Programmer, please keep analysing their communications - find out if these signals are food and deduce what you can about these creatures - how many of them per city? Are they individually intelligent or only as a group?"</p>
<p>"Yesm'm."</p>
<p>"Engineer, work on ways around this laser shield - could we misdirect them using some kind of decoy? Could we split the ship into two? Into three? Consider all options."</p>
<p>Jessica had started drumming her fingers on the panel again, and didn't notice the other two leave.</p>
<hr />
<p>Cruxtus squatted in the freight bay, focused on fixing one of the laser units to punch through the atmospheric distortions. Thick wreathes of acrid cigarette smoke all but obscured the far walls. Amelia Cruxtus had never bothered to understand why she needed thick smoke surrounding her to do her best work - but if she had ever been pressed, she would have eventually recalled the lonesome Martian sandstorms of her youth, back before 'forming had been perfected.</p>
<p>"Stop smoking on the Bridge, Amy, split the ship into three smaller ships, Amy. Stop thinking about clowns, Amy, your Captain doesn't like clowns. Don't give your Captain nightmares, Amy, just do your job, Amy..."</p>
<p>She looked up into the silent fug, took a deep breath, and reached for the next lens for the laser. These lenses had been ground with precision back on Jove; the onboard 'verter could handle bulk but couldn't do fine details.</p>
<p>"Gotta keep talking, Amy, that's how we stay sane out here. That's how a Martian knows she's alive."</p>
<p>This laser unit was almost three feet wide - six times wider than a single laser unit. The wider the beam, the less the atmospheric distortions would matter and the cleaner transmissions would be.</p>
<p>"A wide beam is a strong beam, Amy. Bounce together four pulses with mirrors for intensity, that's good. Yep, then bounce the strong beam out wide to be a whole eighteen wide, and distortions won't do a thing. Reflection, refraction, diffraction, Amy, reflection, refraction, diffraction. That's the way the money goes." Imaginary sand buffeted Amy Cruxtus. "Reflection, refraction... diffraction."</p>
<hr />
<p>Several fruitless days later Captain Guilia Stanes dreammed poorly, her dream hands grasping a silken rope. Above, a robotic ape held the rope's other end, a smile of gross satisfaction upon its face; below, fires raged across a devastated city. The ape fumbled and the rope slackened sickeningly. Her conscious mind, watching but unable to influence, was grateful that there were no clowns.</p>
<p>Her eyes snapped open; the cityscape was replaced by her stateroom. On rising it became clear what was wrong - her cabin was a mess, gravity was off-kilter and the ships engines were humming loudly.</p>
<p>"Programmer, report!" She 'pathed. "Are we under attack?"</p>
<p>The minds of her crewmates betrayed tension, but not outright fear. Stepping onto the bridge she saw her Programmer steering the ship through the weak thermals of the mesosphere, her Engineer at her console manipulating more threads. Engineer Cruxtus glanced over at her entrance.</p>
<p>"Glad you could make it, Captain - I've already released the grid and I'm ready to transmit. Can I get your order?"</p>
<p>"Released the what? I demand to know what is happening here."</p>
<p>Thornton looked up. "Atmosphere's getting hotter, ma'am - they're shifting their lasers on to us."</p>
<p>Cruxtus persisted. "May I have your order, ma'am? The grid won't be at the right height for much longer and I need to transmit the new message now."</p>
<p>Captain Guilia Stanes sank into her command chair, disoriented and half asleep. "Yes, yes, transmit. And then there will be explanations, Engineer."</p>
<p>"Aye, Captain." Amelia Cruxtus grinned and turned back to her console before pulling a single cord. "Confirmed: The wide beam successfully hit the grid, Jules."</p>
<p>"Taking us up."</p>
<p>"Programmer Thornton," spat the Captain. "Why did you take the ship into the atmosphere without my order?"</p>
<p>Thorton, confused, glanced at Cruxtus before replying. "Er, you were asleep?"</p>
<p>Stanes swung her gaze onto the Engineer. Cruxtus felt a smile spread across her face and the telepathic presence in her mind. Grabbing a fresh packet of smokes from her pocket, she lit up, enjoying the look of fury on her Captain's face.</p>
<p>"Sorry, Jules. That laser shield might be hurting sentients and I had to act as quickly as I could." A puff of smoke drifted across the bridge. "Our grid let us reach a good thousand square mile patch."</p>
<p>"Tell me exactly what has happened."</p>
<p>Cruxtus took another drag on her cigarette and stretched out her legs. "Well, Jules, I modified a laser unit to punch through the atmospheric distortion, and just as I finished Jess cracked their language-"</p>
<p>"It was food, Captain," broke in Thornton. "Some cities were starting to starve."</p>
<p>"-and so we transmitted the greeting message to the reciever station furthest from the central node."</p>
<p>Stanes began to glower. "That doesn't require entering the atmosphere."</p>
<p>"They lasered back that they didn't want it, Captain." Amy puffed again. "Just like the central node. So I changed tack.</p>
<p>"They didn't want your standard greeting message - seems they don't care too much about peace, love and assimilation. We only had one chance, so I had to think on my feet and think of something they couldn't ignore - in fact, something they just couldn't put down."</p>
<p>Stanes practically growled. "Why did we - you - only have one chance?"</p>
<p>Amy grinned. "We only had one diffraction grid, Cap'n."</p>
<p>Stanes really did growl: "Explain."</p>
<p>"We know they don't mind starving their own if it keeps us away. Who's to say, if we did get one city to start talking with us, the rest of them wouldn't just re-aim their lasers and melt them to slag? If we were going to convince any of them, we had to convince lots of them at once.</p>
<p>"Our laser had to be wide and powerful to get through the distortions, but then it would only reach one city. If we could drop a diffraction grid - a fine mesh that, when a laser pulsed through it beneath the distortion layer, would make the beam spread out into a cone - then our single pulse would spread wide enough that we could reach hundreds or even thousands of cities. Diffraction grids are small, too, only a foot or so across and an eighth thick, so they'd likely not detect it.</p>
<p>"Now, our 'verter is a neat bit of kit - it can scan and create things, down to a width of a quarter-inch, but nothing smaller than that. I needed a really fine set of holes in my grid to diffract the laser out as much as possible - around one tenth of a sixty-fourth. Funnily enough there was only one thing on the ship that would do the job."</p>
<p>Guilia Stanes' face went from a dangerous red to a pale white. "My needles - you -"</p>
<p>"Every last one," said Engineer Amelia Cruxtus. "I had to stop those poor folk from starving, see, so I had to make sure my message got through to their 'verter recievers."</p>
<p>"You dropped my needles onto the planet?" A bit of colour came back into Captain Stanes' face. "What made you so damn sure your message would be worth it? What damn message could be worth disrupting my Vice?"</p>
<p>Amy Cruxtus, Martian by stock, grinned.</p>
<p>"Well, like I said: It'd have to be something they'd appreciate right away so they'd want to talk to us. Something they just couldn't put down, so they had to talk to us. Something that would be good for trade - with the good stuff dragged long-haul all the way from Sol rather than 'verted from a pattern by the locals. I'm pretty sure they'll call back any minute." An intelligent thread started glowing green. "Incoming message, Captain - are we at home?"</p>
<p>"Cruxtus, either you tell me exactly what you transmitted," enunciated Guilia Stanes, "or I make you go fetch my god damn needles on the end of a rope, lasers or no lasers."</p>
<p>"Well, Jules," drawled Amy, lighting her next Camel from the butt of the previous one, "alls I'll say is I hope you like the smell of tobacco."</p>
