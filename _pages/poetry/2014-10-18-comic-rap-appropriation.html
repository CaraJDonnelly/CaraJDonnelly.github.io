<p>What is appropriation?</p>
<p>Taking the makings of nations or patenting faux racial clash; the idea?   Turn bourgeois fear into cash.  Rap music's grown on me; fast, rhythmic poetry that stylistic'ly <i>must </i>address the social economy.  "Keep it real"'s the feeling you see in all record deals.</p>
<p>Is "white rap" racist?  No chance, mate; it's a method of expression and expressing an oppression not racial but spatial - living with the council.  It's learning a hard lesson in lyrical window-dressing, where sick rhymes give rise to rhetorical grime.  <i>My</i> intent simply rests on testing my mettle by obeying a form so confusing and fettered, but I'll never disrespect all my rap betters.</p>
<p>Rap ain't a joke; it's blues or punk music.  Like any other art form you use it when you're losing hope, groping for the light at the end of a rope.  So "Rap News" or "Rap Battles of History" make me confused; a fusion of white rap; funding; comedy where the joke's simply seems to be "famous figures speak rapidly".  The rhymes are tight and they strike the right mood, but I worry it's not right and I worry it's not good.</p>
