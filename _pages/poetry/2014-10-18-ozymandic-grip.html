<div class="mbl notesBlogText clearfix">

<p>The sail roars overhead<br />
Screaming in the breeze<br />
With taut iron chains<br />
Twixt cloth and wood;<br />
A flowing, barren frieze.</p>
<p>This ship has never had a crew<br />
Nor rested in a port<br />
But steers as though by weathervane<br />
O'er Sea.Â  Aye, free from sense<br />
And free from law<br />
And free from human thought.</p>
<p>What cargo rides a barren ship?<br />
What fool would seek to know?<br />
Who'd tread on planks from Jones himself<br />
Touch salt soaked cloth, breathe cool dead air,<br />
Bear mortal dread to grow?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, do not board the Ozymandic Grip;<br />
Do not chart its way.<br />
The twisted canvas, twisted grains<br />
Twisted screams of twisted chains<br />
I warn you: Stay away.</p>
