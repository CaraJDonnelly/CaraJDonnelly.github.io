<p>I am an insane scientist;<br />
I've chosen to eschew<br />
Morals, reasons, sense and fears<br />
And blasted peer review.<br />
I've raised the unclean dead, it's said,<br />
And bred malarial mice<br />
Whose poison stings and leather wings<br />
Killed Helsing in a trice.</p>
<p>My grand abode, although quite vast<br />
Will never feel like home<br />
For now Elizabeth's gone away<br />
I only feel alone.</p>
<p>-Viktor Frankenstein</p>
