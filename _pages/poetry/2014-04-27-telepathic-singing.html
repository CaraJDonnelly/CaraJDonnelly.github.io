<p>This is a short memory that makes me want to become a jazz musician.<br />
There's a shortform game called One True Voice; a group of people watch each others lips and tell a story or sing a song.  The Cambridge Impronauts used to play this as "Twinkle Twinkle One True Voice" - two people sing a short song to the tune of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star on a topic chosen by the audience .  For simplicity, one person is leading, singing very slowly, and the second following by watching the lips of the first person.</p>
<p>A sign that a group has meshed well is that people are disconcerted and excited by this game.  Whilst singing, the improviser following must initially simply follow the leader and try to make coherent words and sentences, but after a little while you just find chunks of sentences appearing in your head.  "This," says your brain, "is the natural finish to this line, and this is the line afterwards.".  This is borne out by the lip movements of the leader; you both act in synchrony and speed up, singing at an almost natural rate.  The effect is spooky and lots of fun.</p>
<p>We tried this once with five of us, sitting in the Larkum Studio in a pentagon.  I would follow the person opposite me and slightly to my left and be followed by the person opposite me and slightly to my right; everyone else did the same and this formed a closed loop.  We told stories, the words coming from nowhere, about mars bar trees and pennies.</p>
<p>Oh, except the first story.  That time we opened our mouths and chorused as one "NOBODY LIKES ME.".</p>
<p><i>That</i> was spooky.</p>
