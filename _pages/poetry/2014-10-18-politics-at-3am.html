<p><em>Press pen to pad with restless dreaming</em><br />
<em>In bid to quell my metric daemon.</em><br />
<em>For one shall find that one is blest</em><br />
<em>When meter's met and one may rest.</em></p>
<p>I claim as my scene body politic in sense of modern youth.  In sense of<br />
Reddit and Twitter, of Brothers Koch and noxious light shone<br />
Down exposing social cracks.</p>
<p>Whatever happened to the ladies that voted?<br />
That took note of the day and goings-on?<br />
I charge them with the eternal crime:<br />
They grew up.</p>
<p>Why care to vote when the men in charge are<br />
Bastards, thieves, lacking gumption or merit,<br />
Lacking even power.  When Google shows us the world<br />
Then tells us that the world avoids their tax.</p>
<p>Facebook, now, necessary for any advertorial excursion<br />
To the sharp exclusion of those disconnected,<br />
Tells us that they avoid their tax.</p>
<p>Amazon, the goldmine on which Internet novelist's dreams<br />
Are based, even if everyone agrees their workers pay should be raised<br />
Tells us that they avoid their tax.</p>
<p>The Rich may speak and tweet and beat the Taxman back<br />
While the Real find ourselves contained into a hostile walled garden.<br />
Why vote?<br />
Why not smash instead - remind the scum<br />
That the angry youth aren't stupid - just dumb.<i> </i></p>
