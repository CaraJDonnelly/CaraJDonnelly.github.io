<p><em>I was lucky enough to take some poetry lessons with the prizewinning <a href="http://missjonespoet.tumblr.com/">Emma Jones</a>.Â  In this poem, which I wrote for one of her classes, I try to express something abstract in an immediate way - the thing I am describing is actually Chapter One of my PhD thesis.<br />
</em></p>
<p>Gather round!<br />
I would tell you a story.<br />
I found, one past winter's day, a pair of binoculars<br />
In seven pieces, sitting on a rock, on a wild hillside<br />
With no-one around for miles. Slotting<br />
The pieces together I<br />
Marvelled at how they fit,<br />
Found, as they were, on that wild hillside<br />
Untouched by the heat of life.</p>
<p>These pieces, each of them<br />
Were light<br />
And cool to the touch.<br />
I puzzled there for weeks as to how they might fit together.<br />
One by one<br />
They would slot in<br />
And fall apart<br />
As a confusion of waves rushing up a beach<br />
Falls back into the sea.</p>
<p>Six were simple, and a seventh stuck them together<br />
But Gordon came by, and pointed out two more<br />
Shaped as the seventh<br />
(He has seen more binoculars than I)<br />
And that meant that those ought go in the middle.<br />
I started again.<br />
Nine pieces, three in the middle, unchanging<br />
With six affixed and free to oscillate around them.<br />
These wild binoculars, so beautiful,<br />
Waver in my hands;<br />
Rushing together like water waves filling a loch<br />
Then melting apart as though sloughing off the burden of existence.</p>
<p>Did I say nine?<br />
...I meant eleven, with two pieces found long ago by meticulous explorers:<br />
Friedman and Schutz.</p>
<p>Eleven steely-silver pieces<br />
Each pretty and well-formed<br />
Every one a joy and a promise made<br />
By that wild hillside.<br />
I, lucky traveller, have heard that promise.</p>
<p>The rich hinterland speaks<br />
And I listen as best as I can.<br />
When I understand this gift,<br />
When it has come together,<br />
I shall heft it in my hand<br />
Raise it to my eyes<br />
And you and I shall watch the planets dance.</p>
