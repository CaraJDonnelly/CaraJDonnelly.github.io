<div class="entry-content">
<p><em>Software-development humour.</em></p>
<p>You’d better watch out<br />
You’d better code DRY<br />
You’d better not pout<br />
I’m telling you why<br />
The head of Ops is making the rounds</p>
<p>He’s making a diff<br />
He’s checking it twice<br />
He’s gonna `git blame` who’s naughty or nice<br />
The head of Ops is making the rounds</p>
<p>He sees you when you’re merging<br />
He knows when you rebase<br />
He knows if you called fetch or pull<br />
So don’t pull for goodness sake[1]</p>
<p>With unit test suites and Agile day scrums<br />
Pre-commit hooks and `git bisect` runs<br />
The head of Ops is making the rounds<br />
The head of Ops is making the rounds<br />
The head of Ops is making the rounds</p>
<p>[Chorus: He sees you when you're merging...]</p>
<p>[First verse reprise: You'd better watch out...]</p>
<p>(Making the rounds)<br />
He’s a busy man; he’s got no time to play<br />
He’s got millions of branches to merge before release day<br />
(The head of Ops is making the rounds)<br />
(Making the rounds)<br />
(The head of Ops is making the rounds)<br />
(Making the rounds)</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>[1] Pulling rather than fetching can introduce an unnecessary merge commit that clutters up the history.</p>
