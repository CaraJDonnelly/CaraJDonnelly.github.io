<p><em>(to the tune of 'California Dreaming'.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Scansion note: "'Mer/gen/cy/ debugging" to fit with 'Cal/i/forn/ia/ dreaming'.)</em></p>
<p>All the builds are red<br />
And my face is gray.<br />
Found a fatal bug<br />
On the release day.<br />
I would have no work<br />
If I just looked away;<br />
'Mergency debugging,<br />
Right on the release day.</p>
<p>Fired up gdb<br />
To pass the time away.<br />
Well, I drilled down in the stack<br />
And I proceeded to play.<br />
I know the problem's contention;<br />
I won't find it this way.<br />
'Mergency debugging<br />
Right on the release day.</p>
<p>All the builds are red<br />
And my face is gray.<br />
I found a fatal bug<br />
On the release day;<br />
If I wasn't oncall<br />
I could leave today;<br />
'Mergency debugging right on the release day.<br />
'Mergency debugging, right on the release day.<br />
'Mergency debugging, right on the release da-ay!</p>
