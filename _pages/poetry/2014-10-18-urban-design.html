<p>Impetus: <a href="http://www.cityofsound.com/blog/2013/02/on-the-smart-city-a-call-for-smart-citizens-instead.html">this essay</a> by Dan Hill on design of "smart" cities.  The essay, in short, is <a href="http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">The Cathedral And The Bazaar</a> applied to urban spaces; if you let people do what they want with their spaces they'll be happier and surprisingly efficient.  In the same way that the Free Software/Open Source movement will make an excellent browser but never generate Mathematica (huge project, doesn't benefit everyone, huge time requirement), crowd-sourcing urban planning will make excellent gardens and even road design, but never light railway systems (huge project, doesn't benefit everyone, huge money requirement).</p>
<p>The essay claimed that intersections without traffic lights or road signs are safer than those with.  Here's a video of such an intersection:</p>
<p class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img id="BLOGGER_object_0" class="BLOGGER-object-element tr_noresize tr_placeholder" style="background-color: #b2b2b2; background-image: url('http://2.gvt0.com/vi/qgYzyGvMqjo/0.jpg'); background-position: center; background-repeat: no-repeat; height: 266px; width: 320px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/video_object.png" alt="" data-original-id="BLOGGER_object_0" /></p>
<p>I'd like to write more, but I fear it would be waffly.  So let's rap it instead.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>It's no surprise: efficiency lies in good people given their own space to rise; common sense says all streets are alive.  But now our lives are incompetence codified. Science and Enlightenment seen from the cynic's side.</p>
<p>I'm not saying the world's clear, not me.  Innate complexity impacts symphonically, chaotic dances of flying bees, the fall of sleet and dark city streets; these need tests before their secrets are freed.</p>
<p>The problem is investment in questions means questions are limited; our knowledge delimited by things we let pass; where is the dance of a bee under glass?  Making a city spring up over night leaves a question unasked:  "What would you like?".</p>
<p>Cars drive past and I don't see people, I see beetles, shiny and eyeless, inhuman, ill like a spine of pylons crawling their way over miles of sky.  But place those beetles in "shared spaces" with no yellow lines, parking fines, stop-go signs, their movements aren't faceless; now I'm connected cause I know the inflexions of those undirected.</p></blockquote>
