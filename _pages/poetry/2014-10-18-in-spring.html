<p>It is evening, and the blackbirds call out<br />
Quiet textured hoarse screams in temporal counterpoint<br />
To the morrow calls.Â  My housemate<br />
Thumps the air<br />
His voice pounding demands to the<br />
Telephone, pounding through the walls down into the garden.</p>
<p>The birds sing,<br />
And I sing,<br />
And we can hear each other.</p>
