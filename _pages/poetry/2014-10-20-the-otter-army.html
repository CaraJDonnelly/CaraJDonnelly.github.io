<p>(Co-unearthed by Gill Conquest of <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://gillconquest.co.uk/">http://gillconquest.co.uk/</a>)</p>
<p>Stop your frolics in the waters<br />
Drop your fish and hide your daughters<br />
Load your slings and leave your homes<br />
Arm yourselves with sticks and bones<br />
Scream our frenzied battle cries<br />
Hear the Otter Army Rise!</p>
<p>Otters rise! Otters Rise!<br />
Olympic games that we despise<br />
Builders Blood shall soak the skies<br />
Hear the Otter Army Rise!</p>
<p>They'll fill the streams with dark concrete<br />
And tourist's feet shall slap our streets<br />
Despoil our land of milk and honey<br />
Misuse all that public money<br />
If foul Olympic flag still flies<br />
Hear the Otter Army rise!</p>
<p>Otters rise! Otters...</p>
<p>Planners thrashed by Otter tails<br />
Upon them fiery death we'll hail<br />
Gnaw the javelins; drain the pools<br />
Tear the flesh of craven fools<br />
Olympic flame meets dark demise<br />
Hear the Otter Army Rise!</p>
<p>Otters rise! Otters...</p>
<p>Hear the warsong<br />
Dance and sing<br />
Bow before the Otter King<br />
Hear the warsong!<br />
Dance and sing!<br />
Bow before the Otter King!</p>
