<p>In Modern Times, in ill-run schools<br />
There are some things they fail to mention.<br />
A case in point: Teaching the rules<br />
Of verse...</p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>...like Rhyme, or Stress, or (for the sake of Pity!) Scansion.<br />
We hear "The Greats - they paid no heed<br />
To edicts of styles gone past."<br />
False! False, for the factual case, in deed, was that<br />
Wild deviations were not <i>so</i> vast<br />
In number.Â  A thund'rous blast that doesn't<br />
Scan might work for you - so, please, feel free<br />
To lace your opus with such <em>loose</em><i></i> hocus pocus -</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>But I'd <i>hoped</i> instead...</p>
</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>...you'd chime with me.</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>For <i>I</i> find fine verse is so much sweeter<br />
When meter's met; it is then meeter.</p>
</div>
