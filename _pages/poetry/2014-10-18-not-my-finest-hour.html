<p>A killer stalks our manor house<br />
So a sleuth has come to call<br />
To rakes us through the coals and make<br />
The killer take the fall.</p>
<p>The case at once had run aground<br />
With cash and sexual runaround;<br />
Despite a maid, uncovered, bound,<br />
Still the motive stayed unfound.</p>
<p>Now we sit in crackling study<br />
And hear a tale complex and bloody.<br />
I thrill at the fact that<br />
The time is now; oh, <i>heaven</i>, <em>heaven,</em><br />
How your words will make us feel.<br />
I did it.<br />
I killed her.<br />
I <i>love</i> a big reveal.</p>
