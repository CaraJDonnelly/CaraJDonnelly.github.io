<p>I'm free, my bleedin' is done, it's a long summer's day and I'm needing a song; you'll see, when I pay my respects to the <a href="http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/BGML/">B&amp;G Moore Library</a>.  There I'll be buoyed by unbounded joy unalloyed by pain or social storms; that pall will fall straight from my days as I stand there tall in a drunken haze and I hold my PhD.</p>
<p>In finishing I'll sing my supervisor's praise, and wishing him well take a London train, to the filthy city I'm pretty sure from this point on'll form my life's core.  Challenges, new designs that inspire my mind and light up my bright life. I'll be blind to pitfalls; I'll trip balls let the grit fall, clear my eyes with the Highgate scum and the silver fish run when I've got my PhD.</p>
