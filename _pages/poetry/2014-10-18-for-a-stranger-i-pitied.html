<p>I'm new to this town<br />
But you're newer:<br />
You stand much too close, your fingers all clench'd<br />
And I watch like a human reviewer.<br />
A baby-moon face,<br />
Honest nerves so sublime.<br />
Tell me -- well...<br />
...Are you just <i>pretending</i><br />
To ride this crowded Central Line?<br />
Now the crowd of blind poets<br />
Hears the chant it abhors:<br />
"Please do not block the doors.<br />
Please do not. Block. The doors."</p>
<p>The wheels give rise to thunder<br />
As the silence reigns above:<br />
Are you the the only one there<br />
With eyes that could show love?<br />
I know that you are frightened<br />
And you feel you're out of place;<br />
Flat air that's only lightened<br />
When you leave.<br />
Now walk faster, now you stumble<br />
As the clockwork wonder roars:<br />
"Please do not. Block. The doors.<br />
Please do not. Block. The doors."</p>
<p>Outside the street is grimy and<br />
The Sun lights only grey,<br />
In your footsteps there's a struggle and<br />
We wonder "will she stay?"<br />
In this joyful vibrant city we need<br />
No-one with your flaws.<br />
"Please do not. Block. The doors.<br />
PLEASE DO NOT.<br />
BLOCK.<br />
THE DOORS."</p>
