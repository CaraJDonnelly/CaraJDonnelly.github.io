<p>Hey there!  Thank you for subscribing; you'll now receive an email when I upload a new story or a new essay about improv, whichever you selected.</p>
<p>The Internet is a strange place, where minutes-old content runs on decades-old networking technology, and Facebook and Twitter and Google and Amazon and Apple and Reddit are all trying to convince us that their vision of community is the best and only.  Thank you for avoiding all of those twisting mechanisms and letting me connect with you directly.  To celebrate that connection, here's my favourite poem of JRR Tolkein's:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Road goes ever on and on<br />
Down from the door where it began.<br />
Now far ahead the Road has gone,<br />
And I must follow, if I can,<br />
Pursuing it with eager feet,<br />
Until it joins some larger way<br />
Where many paths and errands meet.<br />
And whither then? I cannot say.</i></dd>
</dl>
