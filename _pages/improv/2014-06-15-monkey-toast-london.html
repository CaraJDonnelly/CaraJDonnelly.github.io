<p>These are my notes from my classes with Monkey Toast, a London school run by David Shore.  I would characterise his style as 'clean' improv, in the sense of 'undistorted' improv - he pushes us to make clear choices and communicate as clearly as possible with our classmates.  My notes for these are incomplete.</p>
