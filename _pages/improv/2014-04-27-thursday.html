<div id="post-body-5093140106179156895" class="post-body entry-content">I thought I'd missed most of today because of a second interview with $_AWESOME.  I turned up at 4.30pm anyway, to show my face and catch the end.  We did a physical invocation of "shamrocks" leading to a thesis of "we are magic" to start the first beat of a Harold.  Tara told us that Seinfeld is explicitly a Harold, as is Love Actually.  Tempted to try it as a writing exercise now.</p>
<p>I'm extremely glad I turned up: not only were people all like "Hey!  You made it!  How was it?" but I got to sign JMA's birthday card and have some of his cake.  Then pub.</p>
<p>Later, I saw the Maydays "Confessional".  People write a simple confession down and put it in a bucket.  The Maydays read out the confessions and either do sketches or sing songs about them.  The theme was surprisingly light, given that the first three confessions were about killing a puppy, pressuring people into sex and feeling guilt about it, and paying for a prostitute who sat and cried about supporting her children.  The buckets were then put aside and they asked a lady in the audience to describe a time she accidentally ruined a chocolate cake in a shop but did not pay for it.  This was interspersed with excellent singing and music.</p>
<p>(It wasn't quite my cup of tea, tonight - all week we've been learning about "truth" in scenes and longform, and this was solid shortform.  Very impressed by how they handled the suggestions that they did not want.  Thought maybe the "confessions" aspect could be clarified to avoid the dark stuff.)</p>
<p>Later still I saw Austentatious.  Now, I don't often give orders on this blog, but I am giving one now.  Go and see Austentatious.  They made me cry with laughter in their performance of "The Sweet Squeak of the Siren's Song":  A wife who only wanted an apple, a husband obsessed with gluing them back to the trees.  His twin brother obsessed with needlework, wooing a local lady with gifts of gloves, dead squirrels and muesli, whilst her sister looks on disapprovingly.  The father of the brothers glued them to things as a child and gave them their lifelong burdens.  Accompanied by an excellent cellist who really added atmosphere.</p>
<p>This culminated first in a dream sequence: The husband dreams of his father who apologises for his childhood.  The husband wakes up to his brother and explains the apology, only for the father to appear again and explain this is another dream!  The husband wakes and is emotionally healed.</p>
<p>The brother is still mad, and his madness will lose him his love.  His father, grandfather (Lord Pritt) and great-grandfather (Adam Hesive) speak to him in his head and tell him to stop listening to the damn voices in his head (they, who had just told him to bury his travel journal and then woo Miss Charming).  Best lines:</p>
<p>Brother:  You're right!  I'll cease this madness.  I'll bury my travel journal and-</p>
<p>Ghost Father:  No!  Don't bury your travel journal!  That is the act of a madman!</p>
<p>At that point I lost it and laughed through the rest of the damn show.  Special mention must go to the physicality of the Austentatian playing the ghost of the father: for several seconds I was craning my neck to see his walking stick only to realise he was miming it.  The height of the stick, his body weight, all perfect - it was a shock when it wasn't there.</p></div>
