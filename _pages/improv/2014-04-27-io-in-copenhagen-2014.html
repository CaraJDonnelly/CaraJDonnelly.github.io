<p>I want to sumarise the things I learned from the amazing Jet Eveleth in Copenhagen this year - my notes, written up in other posts, are very disjointed because of the speed I was taking them at.  The bits below are what resonated with me hardest: I've not summarised the physical work we did because I would need to work much longer on it for it to stick with me.</p>
<p>The raw notes are linked below I suggest reading this summary and then Thursday and Friday:</p>
<p>[sb_child_list]</p>
<p><b>General Improv</b></p>
<p>Put eye contact with your scene partner on equal footing with eye contact with the audience.  Spend an even amount of time breathing in as breathing out.</p>
<p>Jet described how to find a character which has appealed to me so much:  Be in a neutral stance and throw something out of alignment, allowing the asymmetry to move through the entire body.  <b>Make any vocal sound</b> that feels right to find the character's point of view.  I'd previously been trying to pick a Psychological Gesture, or having an active verb ('wringing') to find a character for me, and the thing I like about Jet's suggestion is how letting out a sound prevents you from jumping into a scene without a character.  It's the thing which really made me understand the phrase 'be in your body'.</p>
<p><b>Longform Improv</b><br />
<b><br />
</b> We would like <b>variety and balance</b> in our longform pieces.  Think like a five-year-old: if the last scene had two people close together, start the next scene with two people far apart.  Standing up?  Sit down!  Fast?  Slow! <b> Respect the 2-person scene</b> and resist jokey walk-ons - this in particular clarified why non-scenic moments in a long form are called 'group games', because as soon as a third person enters the sacred two person scene to make a joke the atmosphere is sharply cheapened and the natural path is for everyone to pile on and play, because the scene is no longer what it was.</p>
<p>Similarly with edits:  If we have had a talky scene let's have an object-work edit to get us more grounded.  If we're lacking connection in our show make eye contact with another player and see what emotion you see in their eyes, and let that drive the scene.  If we're being too grounded start a scene with a vocal edit to quickly establish tone.</p>
<p>(Seeking balance doesn't <i>require</i> the rest of your team to be doing anything more than sweep/tag edits, either: at the start of a scene you are always free to just take a moment to enjoy your spacework a little more than usual.)</p>
<p>In Monkey Toast this week we were working on using monologues as initiations, and I found it helpful to pull out one of each of these: one World (action in a location), one dramatic sentence (last night, "Puberty is coming." a la Game of Thrones) and one point-of-view (gesture and vocal noise).  It'll give the show balance from the start and it helped me remember what I'd pulled out.  I found I was pulling out very simple things and just trusting myself to honour the monologue more (see below about 'being dumb').<br />
<b><br />
</b> <b>Clowning</b></p>
<p>This was magical.  I was able to share a genuine emotion (in my case, relieved and sad tears after a glorious week outside my improv comfort zone) with 20 people, while keeping eye contact with each of them, and I got to see people "in clown" (in vulnerable trance) close up.  I now am aware that there's a level of vulnerability that it is possible to bring to theatre that I previously wasn't able to access; I can't access it now as I am but am very interested in accessing that state and power again.  <b>I wish the week had been longer.</b></p>
<p>I <i>think</i> the clowning has had a permanent effect on me.  It's been difficult not to do dumb things like rearrange the fabric barriers at the airport coming home, or try to drink some frozen soup without my housemate CH stopping me.  I've remembered that dumb things are <i>really fun</i>.</p>
<p>More than that, the strong eye contact coupled with the character work described above has led me to find my scene initiations feel a <i>lot</i> stronger.  I've practised improv on 3 nights since getting back 6 days ago, and I've seen that audiences react very strongly and positively to the character noise.  There's even been a noticeable effect offstage - I was coming home on the Tube last night and had a dumb idea ("What if clowns obeyed the same rules as vampires?") and I smiled so much and so suddenly that three strangers fairly demanded to know what I had just thought of.  Three strangers, <i>on the Tube in London</i>, because I<i> </i><i>smiled</i>.  Last Friday a man stopped me in the street to shake my hand as I was rapping.  <b>I think it's because the clowning freed something inside me.</b></p>
