<p>Let's rant about improv layers.</p>
<p>Take the game of the scene - the repeated pattern you do for fun during a scene.  Think of it as a violin playing a melody:<br />
<a href="https://www.blogger.com/goog_2111088724"><br />
</a> <a href="https://youtube.googleapis.com/v/nEhh4muiQJk&amp;start=9&amp;end=35&amp;version=3">The game of the scene (violins)</a></p>
<p>Hear those fun twiddles as she plays Summertime?  That's the game of the scene.  It changes each time each musical phrase comes up, each time a new scene starts.</p>
<p>Below that, there's the heart - the relationship between the two characters in each scene, and the real emotions they share with us.  That's the alto singer that touches you.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtube.googleapis.com/v/u2bigf337aU&amp;start=119&amp;end=144&amp;version=3">The heart (alto)</a></p>
<p>Hear that beautiful timbre on "sky"?  That's the heart.</p>
<p>Hell, let's stay with that same video for the rest of this.  The world?  The world is the drums.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtube.googleapis.com/v/u2bigf337aU&amp;start=76&amp;end=100&amp;version=3">The world (drums)</a></p>
<p>If you're a musician, you know it sucks to be playing a piece of music with the percussion missing.  That's the thing that keeps everything ticking!  Without that the notes need to be <i>really good notes</i> to stand on their own.  That's the 'world', where we are and what we're doing.  Keeps everything grounded, everything moving.  Everything else can fade out and leave you with just that and you're still good for a few bars.</p>
<p>Then character.  Character is the bass.  It's a long, slow, thrumming game that stays the same throughout.  Listen to this, and compare what the singer is doing with what the bass is doing.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtube.googleapis.com/v/u2bigf337aU&amp;start=100&amp;end=119&amp;version=3">Character (bass)</a></p>
<p>The singer is giving us her all, and the bass is too, but on a much larger scale.  The bass is playing the long game.  The bass doesn't - mustn't - change over the entire song.</p>
<p>These four things, the violin, the alto, the drums, the bass... there's one layer deeper, still.  <b>All of those things are playing 'Summertime'.  They are playing the same piece of music.  That is the final layer.</b></p>
<p>This is the <b>thesis</b> of the piece, the fact that when you get to the end gives you the feeling of completion.  All of those instruments - violin, voice, drums, bass - were doing different things.  They were playing different roles. They were playing the same piece of music.  You need to realise that this is astonishing.</p>
<p>I saw some Harolds last weekend, and I felt they could have achieved more.  There was no coherence, no thesis.  There were musicians on stage instruments on stage but instead of playing a symphony they played five or six unrelated jazz explorations.  It was disappointing.<br />
<b><br />
</b> Again I get to the end of a rant and feel like I've just expressed something obvious, laboured a point.  But saying things often clarifies them.</p>
