<p>Today (2015-08-02), on Facebook, I left "UK Improv Network", "Improvisational theatre -- group for players worldwide", "European Improvisers' Coalition", and "Worldwide improvisation events - posts to reach the global interest".  Every time I logged in I would have four notifications: a person had posted the same post in all four groups, usually for a local weekly event in London.  With the rate of shows in London as they are, this noise happens several times a day.</p>
<p>This is not how to advertise.  No-one in Europe cares about your event in London -- if they have a reason to care, such as visiting London, they will seek out that information.  By posting your weekly London event in the European and Worldwide groups you are damaging those groups by making them noisy.  Sometimes I see adverts for events with no location specified, like I'm supposed to know the name of a group in Florida.</p>
<p>This is not how to advertise.  Improv is incestuous, and there aren't that many of us in any given town: do you want only improvisers to attend your classes or shows?  If they're beginners' classes then advertising only to improvisers is a particularly bad idea.  If they're professional shows then you should be aiming higher.</p>
<p>This is not how to advertise.  Facebook as a platform is deliberately 'social media'.  We manage our friendships through it and their algorithms take account of what groups you interact with most -- if I post an advert to the UK group and so do you, what ends up happening is that Facebook shows your advert to me and my advert to you, and to almost no-one else -- you can see this when you make posts and it says "Seen by 24 people".  If you want people to see your advert, you'll need to pay Facebook so they treat it as an advert or you'll need to rely on a system you control like an email list.  This applies to people who have joined your groups just as much as people who have not.</p>
<p>This is not how to advertise.  You need to know what you're doing that's working or not so that you can do more working advertising and less not-working advertising.  Posting on Facebook without an understanding of who sees it and how means you're doing something without being able to measure the response.  You need to be able to know when you're backing the wrong horse and spending energy without it working for you.</p>
<p>Work smarter, not harder -- MailChimp lets you send A/B campaigns where you send two different emails with the same event in them to see which is more effective, for example -- and an email list means you know the people who are reading it really have chosen to engage with you specifically as a teacher, not a more nebulous concept of 'improv'.  Try to send high-quality emails so that people get something out of every interaction with you.</p>
<p>Please stop and make a plan before trying to do something big and complex like advertising.  For example, I've had far, far more success by talking to friends one-by-one and explaining that improv is an accessible art form about emotional communication between two people and that I think the world would be a better place if more people felt able to make something up without worrying about being wrong.  It's not dishonest, and it's not using those friendships -- it's involving people I care about in an art form I care about.  Be proud of your improv and tell yourself your friends will have a good time if they come to your shows.  Read a textbook on marketing -- you don't need to reinvent the wheel by trying to figure out what is working or not by yourself from first principles.</p>
<p>This article is one data point for you: the constant advertising rather than conversation has made me leave these groups.  I anticipate being happier for it.  That is not how to advertise.</p>
