<p>I made it to all of this day, and we started talking about the Harold.  We discussed an opening type the section had studied on Tuesday which I do not know the name of, in which everyone physically represents the impetus (example was "wardrobe": there followed a conversation between the unworn blouses and dresses about how their owner never took them out any more).  We also discussed Invocations ("We see"/"You are"/"Thou art..."/"I am"), albeit with no physical dimension: when later in the week we would add a physical dimension I actually felt it diminished it somewhat.  The group games between the beats have format similar to the opening.</p>
<p>The point of these group games is to <i>match</i>, what Giles Reger previously taught to me as <i>joining</i>.  Matching for good group games and enforces groupmind, as well as scenes that are fun to watch.</p>
<p>A little more on that.</p>
<p>I've always done longform with a narrator, similar to the on-stage director some troupes use: whatever the narrator says is <i>true</i>, even if it contradicts something that happens in a scene.  The idea of this was to resolve any contradictions between two scenes, to give a recap of scenes gone by, and to give cues to the troupe that the next scene would include a group game (i.e. the middle song would have the simple cue "We come to the middle of our narrative, and...").  The Harold does not need this narrator because the group games <i>enforce</i> group mind by prohibiting new offers within them: the performers agree and agree and agree until the thing that they are agreeing on suddenly appears in a pithy statement (examples from lessons: "We are magic", "We are all accidents", "We believe in each other and so we care about each other").  I've been thinking about this agreement as a resonance that builds between the performers - each spoken line or action tugs the show in a slightly different direction but the overlap between the suggestions becomes more and more obvious.  Because everyone is on stage for the group game everyone has the "thesis" (outcome idea of the game) in the forefront of their head: no need for a narrator to draw people together.  The narrative can then support or disprove the thesis.  Each group game in a narrative yields a new thesis which is compatible with the previous ones.</p>
<p>As I've written in these posts I was away for two of the five days, and consequently I would come back in and feel a little out of step with the section.  Then we'd do one group game and I'd be in lockstep again.  Incredibly valuable lesson to have learned.</p>
<p>-------------</p>
<p>In the evening I stuck around to watch Impromptu Shakespeare and was happy with what I saw: Duke of Norfolk at war with Duke of Suffolk, twins separated in childhood seeking one another, lots of alluded-to sexy times, and lots and lots of mistaken identities and silly disguises.  I was impressed by: the man playing the chef, who played an excellent "oaf who decided to be a traitor", an extremely difficult role, the narrative and humour, which was a good approximation of Shakespeare, the language use by the cast, again an excellent approximation of Shakespeare, and finally the fact that when "Identical twins" was drawn from the Shakespeare Hat and the audience was asked to give examples of famous twins, JR said "the Lannisters" from Game of Thrones.  In the narrative that followed we not only had some twins trying to sleep together, but also the climax naturally fell at a good approximation of the Red Wedding, which is pretty good for a fact related to a suggestion given 50 minutes ago.</p>
