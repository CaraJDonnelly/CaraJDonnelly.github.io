<div id="post-body-6020684329389043840" class="post-body entry-content">This will be an extremely short post since I am quite tired.</p>
<p>Today was an excellent day.  It was the first day of the five-day intensive improv course iO in England.  I am in Clark section (apparently a suburb of Chicago) under the instruction of Tara.  Classes ran from 10:30-5pm.  Everyone in the class, as may be expected with improv, was lovely.</p>
<p>There was an excellent game which rocked my mind a little.  Person A must confess something to person B.  B must then confess something related which means the original confession is now seen in a different light (or is now inconsequential).  There are some examples that I can remember at the end of this blogpost.</p>
<p>The other interesting thing was Tara teaching us that a natural outlet for a laugh is when someone pauses to think, or otherwise takes a moment to display humanity.</p>
<p>Lots more happened today, but I am too tired to record.</p>
<p>--------------</p>
<p>Examples:<br />
A: I don't want kids (to a lover).<br />
B: I have a secret family (so I have been cheating on you).</p>
<p>A: I found out that I am adopted.<br />
B: Your real father is your grandfather; I am actually your brother; your mother doesn't know.</p>
<p>A: I fancy your dad.<br />
B: I have never enjoyed sex with you.</p>
<p>A: I spent your college money on plastic surgery.<br />
B: I don't want to go to college; I am a stripper.</p></div>
