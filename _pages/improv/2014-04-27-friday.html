<p>These blog posts have been so short so far because I have been getting home at midnight each night after an amazing day, with no energy to write.  This one should be longer.  Still sentence fragments: still in a rush to get all this down.</p>
<p>First, if it's not clear by now, I have had one hell of a week.  Aside from the trying-to-move-and-failing and the two job interviews my week at iO has been one of the best experiences I've ever had.  Improvisers are people that say yes, and being surrounded by improvisers all week to learn and do improv has been just the best holiday you could imagine.  If iO do this next year, I sure as hell will be there and you should be too: there were people with years of experience, but also people with nine months of experience.</p>
<p>The group I was in was incredibly strong.  I suppose there's some selection effect going on in paying for an improv course, but it was still a happy surprise.</p>
<p>Yesterday my section carried on with the Harold work:  Opening (physical Invocation), beat one, group game, beat two - and then stop.  We didn't get as far as beat three, where the streams cross organically, but to come to that from scratch in a week was pretty great, given that the iO course in Chicago takes two years.  We then joined with another section to perform what was called either a soundscape or a Bat, but which a Wiccan amongst us described as a Cone of Power.  Intense.  This was a loose-form narrative in the dark, where we are making sounds together as one, with scenes occurring naturally over the top.  Although the form was loose, there was an identifiable group-game in there, and we moved easily backwards and forwards through time in an way which felt <i>narrative</i>: we started at the beginning, then we went to the end, then we recalled the beginning again.  Tara challenged us to guess how long it lasted: I guessed 25 minutes; a few people guessed 30 - Tara gave the impression that most people guessed 10 minutes or less.  She, recording the narrative, told us it had lasted 42 minutes.  Intense.  We then went back to the Nursery and ran two Armandos and a few Harolds.</p>
<p>At the pub we discussed how this didn't feel like a work dinner, or like dinner with strangers; our section had bonded <i>really</i> well in a short period of time.  I did wander out for some fresh air for a while - pubs with generic bass-heavy playlists that interrupt people's conversations do my head in a little.</p>
<p>The closing party was lovely and civilised: one room with tables and tea lights, one room with hip-hop band <a href="https://www.facebook.com/excursionsflow">The Excursions</a>, who ran a hip-hop spelling bee, played a whole bunch of songs, got an audience member up to rap, and were generally awesome.  There were also some sick moves on the dance floor - with their synth player coming down and challenging audience members to a dance off.  The Excursions were not only a good band and gave us a good night but reassured me that I wasn't starting to get some kind of fear of loud noises or anything - music in music's place is all.</p>
<p>Recap:  All of iO in England was amazing.  Walking in to the room with my section felt like walking back in to the place I was supposed to be - and I wasn't the only one that felt that way.</p>
