<p>Monkey Toast were the first long-term improv lessons I'd taken.  In Level 2, taught by Paul Foxcroft, we began to focus on the foundation of longform, covering sweeps and tags, and simple initiations.  It was a level that anticipated the Harold work we would be doing in Level 3.</p>
<p>The first third of the course was about 'getting out of your head'.  Again, having done a fair chunk of (untutored) improv previous to this course, these exercises were largely lost on me as an improviser.  I am glad I noted down what they were, and I am glad that we went over them; I was very surprised and not a little alarmed to find how in their heads my classmates were.  That reminds me of the style in which Keith Johnstone's <em>Impro</em> is written - its advice involves being quite firm (rough, even) with students that one is teaching, in a way I remember thinking was completely incompatible with a self-teaching student group.  I think I have definitely lost sight of what I first found hard in improv, and so a part of what I'm getting out of this is an understanding of what Monkey Toast sees as the fundamentals, and in what order they think things ought be taught.  Over time, I look forward to taking similar courses at different institutions and, in learning, learning to teach improv effectively.</p>
<p>We covered tags ins, edits to advance the current thread by moving a character around in space or time, and sweeps, edits that start new scenes and change thread.  Monkey Toast's style is to edit early, and to get a lot of the team involved in each scene, playing background and extras; the more visually interesting a stage-picture is, the less pressure on the performers in focus and the slower and more satisfying a scene can be.</p>
<p>We started to work on using monologues as idea generators for the opening, and I realised that truthful monologues, monologues that recount memories, are non-performative, at least in a basic sense of emotional vulnerability; we become less conscious of our body language as we get caught up in our memories, and so our true self shines through.  Here I could apply Jet Eveleth's idea of balance: I can take from a monologue a vocal initiation or emotive line, a World like 'changing rooms at the swimming pool', or a physical motion of the monologist to find a character; I would use whichever the piece seemed to be missing.  Months later I realised that this was pushing me always to be vocal, something I want to get away from.</p>
<p>This course culminates in a simple longform based on the Armando: the Commando.  Again, I get the sense that Monkey Toast is trying to take care of its students by launching the boat HMS Improv as gently as possible.  The first time we did to a piece, none of our characters had names and I found I was rushing on stage in a state of unreadiness; I realised I needed to work on trusting my teammates and trying to give them my best, rather than my fastest.</p>
<p>Topics: tags, sweeps, monologues, specifics, getting out of your head</p>
