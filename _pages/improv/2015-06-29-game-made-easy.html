<p>C3Something had organised a visit from Christian Capozzoli, the author of "The Aerodynamics of Yes", available from <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/aerodynamics-of-yes/id580548442?mt=13">iTunes</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aerodynamics-Yes-Christian-Capozzoli-ebook/dp/B00ANZ29KG">Amazon</a>.  I read this book immediately after I first read the UCB Manual of Improvisation, and it was refreshing to consume two contrasting viewpoints in quick succession.  The UCB Manual, when read in isolation, can seem a little mechanical, while The Aerodynamics of Yes read to me like a blunt challenge along the lines of "Here are some simple actions you can take to improve your grasp of this art.  Why aren't you doing them?".</p>
<p>Christian communicated in a fast stream of varied metaphors, some concrete and some more abstract.  This workshop was his "Instant Game" workshop, lasting three hours.  As usual, quotations are approximate, mistakes are mine, and if I refer to other attendees, it is by initials only.</p>
<p>Our aim as growing improvisers, he began, is to become like perfectly spherical clay, able to roll in all directions.  A single school's teaching will roll us out like a cylinder, able to roll in one direction only.</p>
<p>We begin by throwing an imaginary knife around a circle.  He admonishes us to stand on the balls of our feet with our knees flexed, ready to move like a clown or lacross player in any direction at any moment - ready to contribute and participate in whatever we see in front of us.  We add another toy to the knife-throwing game, a call-and-response of "Shh, she's sleeping" that yields "Aww, a baby!" cooed by everyone else.  The idea of this exercise was to get us moving without thinking - "If things are no brainers, just do them." and to get us to "rejoice in your choice".  If we prescribe in advance the things we're going to do then things aren't fun, but if we know "A implies B", and then A happens, it's fun to do B.</p>
<p>Christian launched another metaphor: If a scene starts as ICE then HEAT can make it WATER and later STEAM.  MOVEMENT is a thing that supplies HEAT and lets a scene grow.  PRESSURE can melt ICE too, so STAKES can help a scene grow.  Conflicting goals can yield higher stakes.</p>
<p>"Physicality yields a reaction [from the audience and our scene partners] because it has no words."  We can use words just to colour and add texture to our scenes.  "We want to take off into our scenes with deliberateness and intentionality."  We can love our ideas.  We can interact and make our ideas live.</p>
<p>I ask if "A implies B" means that "not A implies not B", that is, if the Game of the scene has been established that someone gets flustered any time they are asked to make a decision then that person should /not/ get flustered if someone is /not/ asking them to make a decision.  He responds in the negative, and explains that if we had more time we would cover this cross-pollination of games so that if we have two Games established in a show, say "A implies B" and "C implies D" then it can be fun later on to have "A implies D" or "B implies A".  Imagine if a Game were someone leading the Seven Dwarves and being very pompous when doing so - and then later on imagine Dopey, the runt of the litter, trying to be pompous and lead and just marching off the stage with no-one following him.  That's tough to play, but can be great.</p>
<p>Following on with that example, we play Snow White and the Seven Dwarves: ~eight people take the stage on the back line.  One steps forward and is Snow White; she e.g. throws birdseed around on the ground.  The Seven all enter and match one another by e.g. being hens.  This game has no words, but should have emotional vocalisations and motions so that we can tell how the farmer feels about the hens and how the hens feels about the farmer.  Immediately after this we play Dwarf and the Seven Snow Whites: someone might enter as a hen, but now there are seven farmers, perhaps competing to feed it.  This is an example of how playing with "A implies B" can be fun, and is an excellent drop-in group game for a Harold.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of a scene should stay the same between beats, in the sense of "played in the same location" or "played with the same characters".  If your scene is important then it deserves its own real estate, its own stage picture, so we avoid the "Irish Graveyard" problem where you've buried a bunch of bones in one big place and when you're digging through in the second beat you aren't just grabbing random things and hoping the audience -- and you -- remember them.  It's charge -- magic charge -- that you lay around the stage.  (This reminds me strongly of comments Jet Eveleth made in Copenhagen).</p>
<p>We work on "Yes, and -- Ooh", were the "Ooh" is how you feel about the "and".  We always want to know what we're doing, and know how we're feeling (again echoes of Jet's "Know who you are, know where you are, know what you're doing").  We don't want our ideas to be like recessive genes; neutrality breeds neutrality and can infect everything.</p>
<p>We play Two-headed Monster, moving from one-person-initiations (in Snow White) to two-person interactions: the two people just Ooh at one another, and never change their opinion about their environment; the job of the back line is to come in and make offers to them to allow them to ooh.  Their scene ends up like a campfire that the back line feeds with logs: just because we /know/ that "the next thing that happens is we put more logs on the fire" does not mean that we rush in to smother the fire with logs.</p>
<p>He talks about Peekaboo!, the game with a baby: if we put our hands in front of our eyes and take them away to the side repeatedly it gets boring for the child; if we're playing realistic people we can give context, relax our grip on the game a little.  It's Chekhovian: we're planting that idea in our show so that later we can run around and touch our great ideas again later.  The audience are like children that we're teaching a new game.  "Every 'and' is an opportunity to unpack it with an 'Ooh'" (this 'unpack' as opposed to 'and' reminds me of UCB's 'exploration' as opposed to 'heighten').  If we aren't listening and 'Ooh'ing then we look like we don't like each other; think of at Christmas where we all make very careful to unwrap each gift from each member of our family one by one and appreciate each gift before unwrapping the next one.  In the same way, on stage, we can take the time to Ooh at each other's gifts.</p>
<p>We move to two different Oohs, making the Two-headed Monster scene more complex by having different viewpoints.  Christian points out that we're doing a lot of verbalising rather than making our ideas concrete and physical.  We can think of our Oohs as a Barometer, checking the pressure of a scene: imagine a bored audience member whose attention we've lost; we need to take our scenes and make them pop off the page.  If we have an idea that we choose not to play then that becomes a recessive part of our show.</p>
<p>(Top Tip: the first repetition of a Pattern or Game -- that is, the second time that pattern appears -- is a great time to implant specific information in the minds of the audience, because this is when the pattern congeals.  This is great for callbacks, if you're writing sketch.)</p>
<p>We practise slow Oohing in fours in the following manner: one person enters, makes three emotive declarations about the environment ("This coffee sucks.").  Then a second person enters and makes exactly the same declarations about the environment.  The first person is astonished -- this is fate!  They are so in sync!  The two of them riff off their shared point of view.  A third person enters and makes a single bold offer in keeping with the point of view (NB: Christian did not use the literal phrase 'point of view'), the Ooh, of the two onstage.  At this point this scene is LIQUID, freely flowing and established.  The Ooh happens between the three of them, the fourth person enters and makes a bold offer and we all Ooh in unison and we are STEAM!  Again, these slow Oohs are a perfect drop-in group game after the first beat of a Harold if that first beat was low on emotional connection.</p>
<p>As with UCB, Christian stresses that we can make our scenes active: show, don't tell, and be a catalyst for what's right here.  "I only give notes because I love people, and I want to help them get better."  Make your scene partner 100% right.  Be dumb, have fun, /do/ today, be more Homer than Virgil.</p>
<p>We move on to a part of the workshop that I found particularly helpful: we work on status.  Christian thinks of status, a number between one and ten, as how the world treats you; think of Vonnegut's gravity in Slapstick, where some days the world is just heavy and it's hard to move.  But whatever you do, you keep trying - your character, if they are a loser, /loses/, because it's in your nature.  If you're a ten, gravity itself pulls lighter on you.  Imagine a nine: everything about them is oiled.  Imagine a two: everything around them breaks as the world resonates with their failure (think of Frank Spencer picking up a fragile item and the end falling off).  At the end of the first beat Christian assigns himself a number between one and ten, and in the net beat, whatever you're thrown by your scene partners, just remember your number.  Your brain can be a three too - "LC pass basketball!" or "LC I'm open I'm here pass the round thing to score with to me because I'm here and open!".  He mentions that you can spend ten weeks working on emoting without speaking, or when you do a walk-on your character can still have a number to add texture.</p>
<p>He mentions that if he's coaching he does advise teams to get together and drill these exercises without him, so that you can perform scenes together and ask each other at the end "Were you an eight?", so that instead of ever being tempted to give notes you are asking questions about your own observations.</p>
<p>We move on to Chakras:<br />
*Head: a Head Chakra wants you to know how they know what they know.  "I was reading page 47 of Scientific American this week..." - but you can still be dumb!  A Head Chakrea thinks of their body as just a way to move their brain around.<br />
*Heart: A Heart wants to comfort you, putting everyone else before themselves, like a Jainist that sweeps the floor to protect the bugs, like Christian's mother saying "Poor mimosas!  Did nobody drink you?" as though they were feeling left out.<br />
*Gut: "I NEED or ELSE.".  A hungry rat in a cage has been pressed to your belly and it's eating its way through your stomach wall.  Naturally, never satisfy the needs of a Gut.<br />
*Groin: "I *crave*.".  Food, or sex - it's powerful!  We shouldn't be ashamed.</p>
<p>We should work in rehearsals to fix our weaknesses.  I personally play from the Head, so in rehearsals I should strengthen the muscles I don't use.  I play a scene as Groin.</p>
<p>Monoscene exercise: take a word and jump from it to a song.  Put that song in the heart of a character, and when you have earned it in the scene, burst into that song; your scene partner who has their song inside their heart will sing along with you with the song that they chose.  The song's the thing for this exercise.</p>
<p>Comment: changing the stage picture before you know who and how you are can deflate the energy.</p>
<p>Exercise: supermarket aisles give you a number, and think of an initiation about the first product you see in that aisle.</p>
