<p>Managed to miss most of today's improv class because of a job interview at $_AWESOME.  I missed a section on music and a section on dance - two of my favourite things!  By the time I arrived - exhausted after a far too long day (A dude on the tube gave me a seat.  Seriously.  That's how tired I looked.) we had moved on to the openers for the Harold.</p>
<p>Until this week I didn't "get" the Harold.  It looked really restrictive - first beat, second beat, third beat, games, games, games.  In person it looks really open - so open I have completely changed my expectation about the type of improviser that will perform a Harold: previously I had expected a short-form improviser slowly moving in to long form, and now I will expect a very theory-driven long-form improviser.</p>
<p>This week is awesome.  I am being exposed to many new ideas.  Tomorrow I shall go and see improvised Shakespeare.  I wish I'd sorted a job and place to live earlier so I could just be soaking up the improv, but even so I'm getting a good dose.</p>
