<p>I was with the Cambridge Impronauts for a good long while, and we did an even mix of shortform and narrative - mostly compere-led narrative with a broad structure agreed beforehand.  Since starting to work more on longform I've understood the context of some of these shortform games and how they can be applied to in a more general improv sense.</p>
<p><strong>Move On</strong></p>
<p>Move On is one of my favourite shortform games: people stand in a line with two people on stage and a caller off to one side.  The two people perform a scene and as soon as they can, the caller says "Move on, but keep..." any element of the previous scene.  The caller gets about half the laughs and has some standard lines they can fall back on ("Move on but keep every first date I've ever had!").</p>
<p>This is the basis of longform: Take your inspiration for the next scene from what has happened previously.  You need no caller.  Jet Eveleth once described this as one of her favourite openings for a longform, as well: very fast (two- or three-line scenes) that you just cycle through until you find one that sticks.</p>
<p><strong>Freeze Tag</strong></p>
<p>To practise character work, try playing freeze tag - but rather than using the starting position as an offer about what your character is <em>doing</em>, take it as an offer about who they <em>are</em>.  Find a vocalisation that fits that starting stance, then perform a scene as that character.</p>
<p><strong>5-words</strong></p>
<p>Play a scene of 5 words at a time, but don't play for laughs.  Play to have every sentence that you say mean something to the other character so that every line you say affects them.  Forget the constraint if it helps.</p>
