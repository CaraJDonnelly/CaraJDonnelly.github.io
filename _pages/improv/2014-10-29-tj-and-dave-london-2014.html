<p><em>If you attended this workshop and are uncomfortable by me describing your role in it below, </em><em><strong>comment below</strong> and I'll edit it to blazes.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.stefanpagels.com/">Stefan Pagels Andersen</a> is doing his hard work bringing Chicago-style improv to Europe, and as part of that he organised a European tour for <a href="http://www.tjanddave.com/">TJ and Dave</a>.  Heck.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._Jagodowski">TJ</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pasquesi">Dave</a> have their own wikipedia page <em>each</em>.  There's a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1370803/">documentary</a> about them - just them.  They are excellent teachers at the top of their games, engaging and very engaged with all of us.  My notes below, as usual, are raw - no point obscuring the points they're making by adding edits - and in this case they're even more incomplete than usual because it was impossible to look away from some of the truthful scenes they were encouraging us to do.  Quotations are approximate.</p>
<p>My digested summary of the below: the bare truth is funny, and if we have either the permission or confidence as performers to follow that truth we all have the ability to bring it out.  When I was on stage people were laughing in all the wrong places, the back of my mind quietly going "What?  That wasn't a punchline/I didn't play a reaction there/that wasn't a setup" - things like saying, maybe a little defensively, "I had a good time at that party last night" got a ripple of laughter, and saying "You don't think to go off by yourself when you're ten" got an 'aww'.  My instincts are not wrong but this is a place they are incomplete in a way which I think I cannot explain using the written word.</p>
<p>What they're teaching seems tied up with emotional vulnerability.  I found it a little exhausting (although each individual scene did become 'effortless') and I need a while to process whether that level of vulnerability is something I want to aim for in my improv (answer: 'Yes.  But all the time?').  Playing more truthfully the night afterwards had immediate noticeable positive impact on the rest of my improv.</p>
<p>The room, the Nursery (Arch 41), had around 22 improvisers in, each taking lots of notes; because this workshop dealt with emotional truth all attendees that I mention, including myself, will be named Alice, Bob, Charlie, etc. in order of appearance.  Obviously I will not name any attendee 'TJ' or 'Dave'.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Dave: "We'll be working on things you might not immediately see the value of".  We go around and say our name, location, and troupe.  He identifies London and Brighton as improv centres and observes we probably all know at least some people present.</p>
<p>We open by standing in a circle and singing anything we want: he immediately upbraids us for playing <em>safe</em>.  What does the piece need?  What is it lacking?  More bass notes?  More rhythm?  "You are beautiful when you are free".  He gives a strong note of not standing with closed posture.  He rephrases "What is the scene <em>wanting</em>?" which is an interesting turn of phrase; "What does the scene want?" suggests that the scene has agency, while the more passive "What is the scene wanting?" doesn't require the improviser to have that same "the piece is a living thing" mindset.  Asking this question in either form moves us out of the first person mindset, "What should I do?", which can be crippling.  Safety, our personal emotional safety or safety of the content of the piece, is not our goal.  TJ points out that we have all identified ourselves as improvisers, and Dave reminds us to 'follow the fear'.  We run this several more times and try to be more adventurous each time.</p>
<p>They get us up on stage half of us at a time, and we perform a "non-narrative" montage with a one-word stimulus with short scenes of around two minutes each.  We're told not to worry about making people laugh at all today.  Part of one way I try to listen during class is to listen to the intent of the teacher; in the first set of scenes I notice Dave gesture to edit very early on and in the next scene Dave and TJ just both call out for the edit vocally.  Dave sits at the front, chin in hand, while TJ floats at the back; it's interesting watching a duo be so opposite in actions and I wonder if it's to avoid presenting an intimidating front.</p>
<p>TJ gives notes after the first montage: Keep in mind the <em>silence</em> that happened after the line where the archer Arthur revealed to Bob that as a child "I wanted to be a king".  No-one was laughing, but that was the line that made us all feel good.  Playing <em>emotion</em> and <em>point of v</em><em>iew</em> is what made those scenes that worked work.</p>
<p>Dave: "Let's talk about what the job is.".  We're not promising to be funny.  We don't have to have a scenario on stage that we understand, really; we just want honesty from moment to moment.  If we think "Establish the who, the what, the where, <em>then </em>we can start the scene, does that mean we haven't started till then?"  We don't get <em>anything</em> of substance from that.  We don't <em>want</em> to label where we are, because labelling doesn't help us any.  Two kids fighting on a playground is more <em>real</em> than the build-up to a big televised prize-fight.  The key is reacting honestly.</p>
<p>TJ: Your initiations so far have always been "Here's what we're doing" rather than being focused on relationship.  We don't need a situation.  Standing and just looking at each other is <em>more important</em> than <em>doing</em>.  He gave the note: "It looked like you were working <em>really hard</em>, and a good scene should be effortless".  "We want to not need to fabricate, but just live with what we have now."</p>
<p>Dave: You can all play less.  "Playing a character is different from playing <em>at</em> a character."  If <em>you</em> know you're sad, then <em>everyone</em> will know you're sad.  Take the time to <em>know</em>, <em>yourself</em>.</p>
<p>TJ: Imagine if we labelled in real life the way we're taught to in scenes.  "<em>Well, I figured you'd know, since you're my doctor</em> - oh, God.  You ever say that you'll be treated for dementia.".  We're going to do two person scenes, and we'll give you an idea of who you are and remove 'invention'.</p>
<p>We start working on truthful scenes; Claire and Diana are first up and TJ gives them the following scenario: "You will be travelling long distance by train, it leaves in about 20 minutes, you're travelling together and you're good in each other's company, and the first line will come from a place of truth."  Claire and Diana start a scene about a heavy suitcase and TJ stops it.  They start again about travelling with barely anything (since Claire is an 'underpacker' in real life) and Dave stops it.  They start again and TJ glisses it to a stop after a little while.  He asks Diana: "Are you an overpacker or an underpacker?"  "Underpacker - well, it depends - !"  "That!  <em>That</em>'s the truth.".  They play the scene again, using the literal truth; we hear engaging true stories about times they have packed too much or too little.</p>
<p>Dave: No-one gets to experience the moment if you're being defensive.  Rethink the rule of 'Yes, and'.  Imagine saying "Let's jump in this fire", and the correct and truthful response to that is "Go fuck yourself", because if it's <em>not</em> that then that means you don't really believe it's a fire, you don't believe it's real.  These scenes are ordinary and wonderful.</p>
<p>TJ: Don't be clever. (<em>I think he means </em>any<em> invention at all)</em></p>
<p>Dave: We're <em>not</em> doing sketches.  We don't need a beginning, a middle and an end.  This is not a play.</p>
<p>TJ: Look at the previous scene (<em>set between Bob and Emily at a wedding</em>); if it had been scripted none of us would laughed at the line "The music is very repetitive/Yeah, that's what I like."</p>
<p>Dave: The feeling in these scenes is that you're both a passenger and a participant.  "The hard part is not doing other stuff."  All these rules of improv that we have are just <em>observation</em>.  In the scenes that worked, these are the kinds of things that happened.  You can do an awful scene that obeys all these rules, and you can do a great scene that breaks all of them.  "What's needed?  What's needed?  What's needed?"</p>
<p>We see an <em>amazing</em> scene where the key thing is Fiona looking at the audience as Bob talks about obscure movie directors.</p>
<p>Dave: Imagine getting a script and counting how many lines the part you've been offered has.  I'd take <em>that</em> (<em>indicating Fiona</em>) part any day.</p>
<p>TJ: "Listening is an action.  Listening is an action."</p>
<p>(<em>We break for coffee.  We come back and onstage Grant and Harriet have an honest conversation about the last time they peed themselves as kids.)</em></p>
<p>TJ: When you're really in it the laughter of the audience comes from a distance, like it has to push through into the reality you're in.</p>
<p>Dave: If you aim for funny and you fall short it's horrible.  If you say "Let's do a good scene" you've got much more room.</p>
<p>TJ: The spacework (<em>in a scene between Isaac and Jenny set in a vinyl record store</em>) served that scene.  It did not dominate.  Some scenes, like being in an operating theatre, can distract you - oh, suddenly I've got to perform surgery.  It's much more likely to be important that you've got a bladed object in your hand while you're talking to someone.</p>
<p>Repeated instruction: Let the first line come from a place of truth. (<em>It's really darn hard to write down stuff while all this truth is going on.</em>)</p>
<p>TJ (<em>crouching on chair</em>): When we play truthfully you suddenly become an amazing actor or actress.</p>
<p>Dave: In a scene, when we ask questions, <em>why</em> are we asking questions?  It's because we're honestly interested in the answer to those questions.  It's never "please, drive the scene for me.  Please, drive the scene for me.  Take control, please, drive the scene for me."</p>
<p>(<em>We watch a scene between Fiona and Kieran set on the back porch of a party.  It's clear the two characters don't know each other; Fiona and Kieran only met today in real life.</em>)</p>
<p>TJ: That scene brought up an important delineating point: With a <em>stranger</em> we <em>expose</em> our truth much more <em>measuredly</em>.  If they say something we disagree with we'll still say 'yes' to avoid an argument.</p>
<p>Dave: How was that scene initiated?  There was some flirting there.  The first three seconds of a scene, and we don't need any words.  We already have everything about the relationship right there.</p>
<p>Getting the truth from your partner by observing them is just selfish good sense.  There's nothing else on stage.  When we start a scene, we join a scene already in progress and we have to work out what that is.</p>
<p>Isaac asks a question: Is it always bad to label things e.g. being in a relationship with the other character?</p>
<p>Dave: It's fine to label an existing truth in a natural way (<em>e.g. if you were talking to your doctor, you would talk about being ill, if you were talking about work with a co-worker, you would ask how their projects are going</em>).</p>
<p>TJ: Just <em>act</em> that way.  If the <em>label</em> doesn't agree with the relationship that's already established, that's fine.  (<em>If we act like lovers but are labelled as co-workers, that's fine</em>)</p>
<p>Dave: That won't throw me, it won't change how I'm acting to you.  Then the only way anything can go wrong is if I'm not paying attention, if I've not heard something you've said.</p>
<p>They stop and start Luke and Matt (who perform together regularly) in their scene set on a cruise ship, and TJ side coaches them to use their real fathers' professions as a basis for the truthful conversation that follows.</p>
<p>TJ: Why do improvisers imagine things that aren't nice?  Why do we all decide to pretend that we have jobs that we hate, and horrible managers?</p>
<p>Dave: I am enough.  I don't even have to <em>do</em> anything to be enough, to command this stage.</p>
<p>Harriet asks about using these truths ("let the first line come from a place of truth") as initiations for scenes.</p>
<p>Dave: -Always.  We always want that, every line.</p>
<p>She asks about choosing between different possible truths when selecting an initiation, keeping in mind the theme of the show.</p>
<p>Dave: We don't want to take the literal truth from an opening; if we have an opening true monologue we don't necessarily want to just start a scene and start re-enacting what happened in the monologue.</p>
<p>TJ: Okay,  we're halfway through a piece and it seems the theme is 'undermining'.  I put that (<em>gesturing to torso</em>) as an emotional truth inside myself and I "look for blackmail".  I'm not going to come in to the scene and (<em>miming</em>) set up cameras, I'm not going to establish 'premise' (<em>c.f. UCB Comedy Improvisation Manual, p93-110, p231</em>), but when you come in and we're co-workers and you say "I'm late again", I'm going to want that to be because you're having an affair.  Maybe you were just stuck in traffic.  I'm going to be <em>disappointed</em>.</p>
<p><em>Why do truthful scenes come so easy in this workshop?  Do we just need </em>permission<em> to play this way?</em></p>
<p>Neil and Oscar have a scene that is emotionally heavy; they are praised for avoiding completely avoiding the <em>intellectually</em> difficult act of invention.</p>
<p>TJ: Scenes are the <em>combination</em> of two people, not addition of two people.  We affect each other and we are open to being changed, if we have a good reason.</p>
<p>Dave: The two people in a scene must observe each other.</p>
<p>(<em>We break for a late lunch.</em>)</p>
<p>We in pairs try to communicate Heat (the intensity of a relationship) and Weight (what's in the room, the atmosphere) using just our face.  It is surprisingly effective.  Adding a title to Heat and Weight cannot disrupt that basic level of agreement - whether we're coworkers slightly annoyed at each other or 40 years married and suspecting the other of being unfaithful, the title doesn't matter if the Heat and Weight are the same.</p>
<p>Dave: We're all doing it, all the time.  Walk down the street - (<em>he mimes looking at a stranger's face</em>) "Are you going to kill me?  Oh, we're cool." - go with your gut.  That's more important than 'the facts'.</p>
<p>TJ: It's not what we say, it's how we say it.</p>
<p>We do a Meisner-style exercise, seven by seven.  For each seven we get a different scenario:<br />
*We approach our room-mate, who is washing glasses, and deliver the line "Great party last night".<br />
*We approach our co-worker (of equal rank) and say "I got the Johnson file."<br />
*We approach our adult child (18-60 years old), who is eating breakfast, and say "Someone got in a little late last night.".</p>
<p>and each of us privately prepares a truth to give us our emotion for the first line (Isaac asks if the truth needs to be literal and about a party, and gets the answer 'no' in response; this 'no' is what makes me identify the above as a Meisner-style exercise and use the word 'prepare' here).</p>
<p>Dave: In a scene if my emotion wanes or the point of view changes, it's because it wasn't clear to me in the first place.</p>
<p>TJ: Great improvisers that I love to watch are doing loads of things that I have no idea why they're doing - but they all know exactly why that character is doing that thing at that moment.  The <em>intent</em> of the player is the difference between a pumpkin and a Jack-o-lantern.  Watching it I might not know whose face it is but I see the light behind the eyes.</p>
<p>Dave (<em>stands up</em>): The more words one uses, the less value each one has. (<em>sits down</em>)</p>
<p>TJ: Scenes start <em>before</em> speech starts.  If our partner's arms go up in celebration and we join them in that, in that emotion, we're home.  That scene between a father and a son had the <em>title</em> father and son, but the <em>nature</em> of co-conspirators.  The title of 'husband and wife' doesn't tell us much - 'newlyweds' is completely different from '40 years married'.</p>
<p>(<em>We're almost out of time, so they ask for questions.</em>)</p>
<p>TJ (<em>responding to a question about returning to characters</em>): When I get back in to a character I've been in before, the most important thing is the mind-space, the point of view.  Sometimes I go 'oh, he held his arm like <em>this</em>' and that might help me.  It's whatever helps.</p>
<p>Dave: It all comes back to paying attention.</p>
<p>Philip: Last night in your show you had your backs to the audience a lot.  Is that a deliberate thing?</p>
<p>TJ: It's more realistic, staging-wise - if we have a bar scene and the bar is at the front of the stage facing out then the bartender should often be facing away from the audience, serving drinks.</p>
<p>Dave: The eye contact between the two of us is most important.  In general, the only time the two of us are not looking at each other is when we're on the telephone (to each other).</p>
