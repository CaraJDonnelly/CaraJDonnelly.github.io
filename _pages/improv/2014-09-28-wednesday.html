<h1>Morning</h1>
<p>The last day of the intensive - so short, so short! - and we do a quick recap of the emotional work from Tuesday.  Lyndsay side-coaches us in emotional scenes set in our own kitchens and our own bathrooms.  How do you feel when you start your day?  Before you go to a party?  Can you establish a clear relationship with someone just by both using the same kitchen?</p>
<p><em>I did not take enough notes; we were standing almost all of the time, which I think is a deliberate choice on the part of Lyndsay.</em></p>
<h1>Afternoon</h1>
<p>We talk about the Harold.  Lyndsay says she has never considered 'crossing the streams' of a Harold as a deliberate aim as was taught by Monkey Toast (though this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBDOMW_87bY&amp;t=23m11s">video from UCB</a> of a one-minute Harold suggests at least some US schools practise it).</p>
<p>In an opening, follow the flow of the group energy.  An opening can take a concrete suggestion to a more abstract theme, and can last from 45 seconds up to 4 minutes (although that video linked just above has a joke invocation that lasts around 22 minutes).  Don't linger on the sidelines - you won't touch the groupmind and you will draw the focus of the audience.</p>
<p>The entire class performs a Harold which can only be titled as "We are all the whales asshole".  Lyndsay for the rest of the class required that each group game was a direct continuation of the previous group game, and called this a 'training-wheels' Harold.  Each group game should advance the theme, and should not refer to the original suggestion.  We should not feel pressure in shows to identify theme and thesis; we should work on that in class and in rehearsals.</p>
<p>We want in Beat One to pull different things from the opening, and let things "come together" in Beat Three.  After each scene, we ask ourselves "What is the shiniest emotional ball?"  That is the pull for the next beat.  She lists some possible pulls:</p>
<ul>
<li>Character pull.  The most obvious and most frequently done pull.</li>
<li>Thematic pull.  (The 'game of the scene' can usually be expressed as a theme, if we only care about relationship-based games.  Lyndsay, when asked about this, gives the example of 'one-upmanship' as a game)</li>
<li>Tangential pull.  If we have "Mr Hiney" in the first beat we might have "Mrs Vagina" in the second beat and "Principal Scrote" in the third beat.  This feels to me like the kind of pull one might do when one has no other choices.</li>
<li>Time dashes.  For a time dash between beats, we need characters to have <em>names</em>, which doesn't happen nearly enough in improv.  Naming a character "Jimmy" in the first beat allows the second beat to start with "Five-year-old Jimmy, get down here!".  Initiation in a scene is your one shot at controlling plot or directing theme; everything after that point is just being in the present moment.(Now imagine if we go from Jimmy in the first beat to Jimmy's mother in the second beat.  We can hug that pattern and chase Jimmy's mother to Jimmy's mother's father in the third beat.  We can pick our pull based on the previous pull, and this creates a very satisfying show.)</li>
<li>Mapping.  What if in the second beat we take exactly the first scene again (which, for example, could be about divorce) and change its context?  Let the second beat be two schoolchildren ending their friendship, using exactly the same language as in the first beat.  Let the third beat be Jesus and Mary days before crucifixion.</li>
</ul>
<p>We discuss tag runs and how that relates to the sidelines being <strong>protectors of the present tense</strong>.  For single tags Lyndsay has made it clear that she expects the original scene to resume very quickly after the tag delivers a one-liner or a very short interaction, and the purpose of the tag is to nudge the original scene back into its own present rather than talking about the future or past.  Tag runs should still end up back in the original scene, because that was the original idea and the original idea was great.</p>
<p>We finish off with two Harolds, each in groups of ten or eleven.  She instructs us to underline the theme with strong eye contact (with the <em>ensemble</em>, not the audience) and a clear statement, and to continue our group games from precisely where they left off - which, to me, gave an immediate feel of cohesion to each piece.  <em>Each group game must advance the theme</em>.</p>
<p>(Occasionally I go home to the Cambridge Impronauts and share what I've learned, and so I try to pay attention to how a teacher interacts with her class.  Here, I <em>think</em> as Lyndsay side-coached the Harolds she was making eye contact with more experienced improvisers when she wanted to signal edits.  I imagine that breaks the flow less than giving a verbal instruction.)</p>
<p>In the Harold I was in I manage to screw up mightily.  The structure of the Harold (as we performed it on Wednesday) is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opening</li>
<li>Scenes: 1a, 1b, 1c</li>
<li>Group game 1</li>
<li>Scenes: 2a, 2b, 2c</li>
<li>Group game 2</li>
<li>Scenes: 3a, 3b, 3c</li>
<li>Group game 3</li>
</ul>
<p><em>NB. some schools would omit Group game 3, and possibly scenes 3b and 3c.</em></p>
<p>As described above, scene 2a takes its inspiration from scene 1a, scene 2b from 1b, scene 2c from 1c, etc.  I had lost track of where we were, and saw that the scene that was happening very clearly (to me) followed on from scene 1c, which I had been in.  So I very firmly initiated the group game, accidentally throwing away either thread b or c.  This should have thrown the group off entirely, but because I screwed up so firmly and clearly everyone know what I had been thinking and the ensemble recovered.  Hurrah for big, big eye contact with SL, the focal character in the group game!</p>
<p>(Lyndsay actually pointed out our group games had become scenic, and so if you counted these group games as scenes within each beat then my game move would have been correct.  I wasn't trying to do anything so artistic and clever, just trying to work out where we were by what scenes followed on from what scenes - I think a team of improvisers trying to think like I thought would create successful shows, but it was definitely a screw-up in this context.)</p>
<h1>Closing questions</h1>
<ul>
<li>Q: How does Lyndsay see 'physical blocks'?<br />
(This obviously refers to something that happened on Tuesday I was not present for.)<br />
A: "By intuition... I ask my ego to step aside to give me a clear channel."  She refers to the spine and a clear channel for air.</li>
<li>Q: How do you get group connection without requiring that initial vulnerability?<br />
A: By making soundscapes, or being sheep (see Monday).</li>
</ul>
<p>I also asked a question about the names we had given one another: do people consciously rename themselves as part of that vulnerability exercise?  She responded in the negative, but with a response that means I need devote a short essay to the question.</p>
<p>Lyndsay finishes by advertising the iO intensives throughout the year in Chicago (and LA), and her forthcoming book "Step One", plus her Youtube channel Chance of Hailey.</p>
