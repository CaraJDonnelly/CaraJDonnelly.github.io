<p class="post-body entry-content">"The game of the scene" is the repeated pattern that occurs in some scenes.  Often one improviser makes an out-there offer, sometimes from a simple verbal mistake, and other improvisers reinforce the mistake again and again until it becomes jazz.  Mistakes are a perfect source of games because literally no-one onstage expected them - they take the scene in a direction unforseen.</p>
<p class="post-body entry-content">Identifying the game of the scene is quite a visceral thing: "Do that thing again", my gut says, and so you do it again.  There are some verbal cues that explicitly offer a game.</p>
<p class="post-body entry-content">When someone says "I believe x" in a scene, they are giving you license to let their character be wrong about "x".  It's much weaker than "x is true", "I know x" or even "I have faith that x".  I hear the word 'faith' as much more emotive and primal than the word 'belief'.  If A said "I have faith in you" to B in a longform, I would take that as an offer that B could nearly betray A over the course of the show then have a crisis of conscience and make the correct moral choice - but a belief is just begging to be incorrect.  "I believe you didn't stab him", "I believe we've paid our rent for this month".</p>
<p class="post-body entry-content">Another cue is "I promise I won't...", which sets up enormous tension on that character to immediately do that thing.</p>
<p class="post-body entry-content">Some games should not be called out because they would break the fourth wall. If someone makes a mistake, (last night I stuttered very slightly when I said 'blues' and said 'buh-blues', and we could have kept that up throughout the scene as a very simple game) then that should not be called out. No-one should say "why are you calling it buh-blues?", since we all live in the same universe and in this universe that style of music is just called "buh-blues". "That's weird" should not be in the verbal vocabulary of an improviser (whilst being always in the mental vocabulary). Games like "people answer the door when the phone rings" should never be called out.</p>
<div class="post-body entry-content">
<p>In contrast, I would say character games can be called out explicitly. Last night one of my characters, snapped at KD "Don't tell me things I already know", which KD immediately picked up on and turned into a game. The scene was super-easy to play because the game we were playing had been said aloud, and it wasn't weird for my character to want things not told to her again and again. The scene tripped along.</p>
<p>We can abstract this distinction: Games which are specific or character can and probably should be called out precisely once ("Pastrami makes her furious", "Anyone that reads this book says 'Bop!' at the end of all of their sentences"). Games which are general and arise spontaneously should never be called out ("you answer the door when the phone rings", "there are lots of dutch people in Surrey") because it breaks the fourth wall and is inferior to simply playing the game straight.</p>
