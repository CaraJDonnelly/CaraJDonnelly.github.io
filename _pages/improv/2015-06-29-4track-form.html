<p>This 7-hour workshop happened the day after Capozzoli's Game workshop - see there for the lede.  As usual, quotations are approximate, mistakes are mine, and if I refer to other attendees, it is by initials only.  His book is available from <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/aerodynamics-of-yes/id580548442?mt=13">iTunes</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aerodynamics-Yes-Christian-Capozzoli-ebook/dp/B00ANZ29KG">Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>We begin the workshop by passing sound-and-motion around a circle with FIDELITY and ATTACK, in the musical sense.  He notes us that we are worrying too much about FIDELITY, that we are hanging back and making sure we understand precisely what the sound-and-motion is before we start to copy it.  He pushes us to copy /before/ we know what's going on.  We do the same exercise with an Alpha - all copying one person who is making motions as unpredictable as possible, and smoothly the Alpha role is taken on by different members of the class (which worked best with ~8 people).</p>
<p>He makes the same note that I heard from Lyndsay Hailley and John Murray, that there's an emotional barrier we're not /pushing/ through.  We need to copy <em>before</em> we know what's going on, because waiting to know what is going on leads to safe and anaemic scenes.  By copying before we know what's going on we're saying "I'm right here with you, I'm taking your choice and putting it in my bones".</p>
<p>Think of ATTACK as THRUST, he says, for our aeroplane.  Our FIDELITY is our WINGS that will keep us steady - but we need both to generate LIFT for our scene.  Hot warm-ups like this (everyone is sweating from running around the room copying each other, crawling on the floor and dancing backwards) shake off the dead feeling you get from the Tube in London.</p>
<p>When a scene feels anaemic and the atmosphere in the crowd drops we react by trying to be funny - but a scene that's got too much 'funny' in is like a bun made with too much cinnamon.</p>
<p>We repeat the Alpha exercise, but trying to be predictable - we make actions that follow from one another e.g. if we all get hit by an arrow following one Alpha, the new Alpha might rip it out of them and shoot it back across the room, and another new Alpha might lead us in being the arrow flying across the room.  We'll take 5-12 narrative steps in this world, exploring "if this is true, then what else?".</p>
<p>(I notice that I play another item or character rather than match - a kid catching a Frisbee rather than a Frisbee, or a baby bird being fed by a puking mother rather than a puking mother.  I can work on that.)</p>
<p>"We need to physicalise our ideas," and "You don't love your idea enough to give it breath." - adding an emotive sound brings your idea to life.  This reminds me of Jet Eveleth's vocalisation technique for finding a character.  Give /breath/.  Give Ooh.  And keep breathing in those choices!  He identifies our offers as being staccato, that we're being polite by occupying focus for as little time as possible - but we can make two statements, we can make three statements.  Imagine crossing a river covered in stepping stones.  It's okay to lead by a few steps, but we do want to take the same path across the river, we want to stay on the same page.  Our scene partner will correct to join us on our path, and we will correct to join them on their path. Don't apologise for being /good/, for having an imagination, for seeing a piano in the corner no-one else saw.</p>
<p>He mentions two-prov versus eight-prov: "If I'm doing two-prov that means I make an offer, then wait /two beats/ before adding texture.  If I'm doing eight-prov I wait /eight/ beats before adding texture."</p>
<p>Canadian Suicides: Three of us run across the width of the room and when we cross the finish line<br />
1) someone makes an abstract motion<br />
2) someone else non-verbally endows it with meaning and breath to make it concrete and give it emotional colour, and now<br />
3) we're all moving spider-webs in a dusty house, and we see a book on a shelf and take it down and blow away the dust.<br />
4) when we all feel we all know where we are, we go "Yeah!" and clap together, then we run back across the room to start a new scene.<br />
All we need to know is where we are, what we're doing and how we feel about it.  By giving breath when we make the abstract concrete we draw the focus of the scene and give life.  Imagine if one of us tried to make the abstract concrete but without giving breath, and the audience saw it but the improvisers didn't.  Then when the scene decided what it *was* about after another improviser made the abstract concrete *with* breath then the audience will feel dumb-and-unhappy because we invited them to use their imagination and then we made them wrong.  Then they'll say "Fuck this.".  He tells us "If you hear something, do it!"  (This exercise was surprisingly hard -- I'd love to work on this more.)</p>
<p>Christian gives us all a tough note about engaging before we know what's going on - a similar note to the "More ATTACK, less FIDELITY" from the sound-and-motion exercise at the top of the workshop.</p>
<p>"You're doing 'improv neutral-face'," and he gawps like someone in awe, "let-me-figure-this-out.  But bringing awe to a scene just makes every emotion be /more awe/ -- and you know what?  That's the expression on the face of the extras in the background of the action film who get /eradicated/.  The things that are textured and sharp are the things that should be echoed."  Imagine entering a monoscene, a scene with only one person in it so far, and if they drop character to listen to you then you're walking in to an empty scene and the emptiness will suck something out of you.  It's like the Neverending Story, with the villain that is the Nothing.  If we equivocate, if we say "that" or "it", then the Nothing creeps into our scene.  But if we give something context, and power and breath, suddenly our scene was always in the jungle with machetes.</p>
<p>The idea of running across the stage in Canadian Suicides is that you have physically committed to being in the scene way before, way before you know what the scene is going to be.  "I don't know what the fuck I'm running into, but I've already committed.".</p>
<p>He speaks more about breath: imagine if Rowan Atkinson as Mr Bean didn't vocalise.  We wouldn't see him in the same way at all.</p>
<p>Touch Their Butt:  We mime closer and closer to touching a shopper's butt (played by a chair) while the audience Oohs louder and louder.  He tells us to Ooh louder even for wrong moves, moves not in the spirit of the scene, because even a wrong move because we can't keep up with our scene partners could buy them time to find the killer line.  If we /shame/ our scene partners for going wrong then the scene cools down as they retreat inside themselves, and the scene goes back from steam to liquid.</p>
<p>What does all this Oohing mean practically?  We'll see that when we add words.  If someone makes the wrong move, and at this point there /are/ wrong moves, we agree, we Ooh and we match.  Then we go back to what we know is right.  Be less [bleep]ing polite.</p>
<p>Lazy improvisers enter scenes with huge energy and then talk about how they entered.  That's lazy!  Offer the scene more.  Matching verbally can distract you from matching physically and emotionally.  I did a scene with RM, EF and AM; RM and I were polite and tried to match an emotion without adding movement - but then AM added a movement that told us Anger, and that overrode our too-polite offer.  We can stop <em>asking</em> people to follow and start <em>leading</em>.</p>
<p>"Physicality is King, Emotion is Queen, and Wit and Quips are the court jesters."  When we come out onto the stage we want to get right to it - because we're great, so we want to start our show.  Physicality: If a team are looking and playing with each other then the audience relaxes.  Emotion:  If something means something to you then the audience gets engaged too.  Wit and Quips: we are <em>anding</em> machines, but we can work smarter, not harder.</p>
<p>Showing you care, Oohing, is like unpacking your gifts at Christmas.  Every gift you unwrap it, you look at it, and you say thanks, "this is just want I needed for" or "It's beautiful!".</p>
<p>He quotes the opening of Lolita: "Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta." - this is Nabokov putting the voice of a monster in our mouth.</p>
<p>Vocal echoing: we return to the circle and give a sentence in a character, all echo that sentence, and someone else is selected to give the second line as that character.</p>
<p>Exercise: Four up.  We repeat a phrase around the circle with attack and with low fidelity.  The gibberish keeps the consonants and new words will appear, coloured by the gibberish, and that colour gives us breath for a new scene.  The fidelity must be high enough to maintain the phrasal quality of the original sentence.</p>
<p>[we break for lunch]</p>
<p>When you walk on stage, be scene-sexy.  Christian tells a story about two people arriving at a party, one confident person with bean dip and one shy person with potato chips.  Everyone tried the bean dip, and the shy person was so shy people literally didn't notice they were there.  Because the shy person didn't love his potato chips, he didn't love himself enough, he didn't share it with everyone.</p>
<p>Verbal matching: we sit, four in seats, and verbally match, with the smallest of heightening to avoid the scene staying polite.  We paraphrase people's last sentences to add support, keeping their vocal texture.  The four on stage can seek a Mantra, a Point-of-View, and just Ooh when they've found it.  When Christian plays solo improv, he keeps four voices in his head, all rabble-rousing, all heightening and saying yes, no voice saying no.  We add a single bit of physicality to the scene by someone going to the fridge to get something for the group sitting down.</p>
<p>If you play a scene out and finish our game we can't come back to it and crescendo at the end of our form.  Trust your group to keep their shit together.</p>
<p>We do scenes, and they get healthier and healthier.  At the close of the workshop, Christian explains the 4Track format for four improvisers: they would do a four-person matching scene that would lead to a tag run, followed by another four-person matching scene that would lead to a tag run.  They used PIVOT or HINGE edits, where you keep the physical motion of the end of the previous scene to smoothly start the new one, and a signal for "SLOW BURN SCENE, DO NOT JOIN ME ONSTAGE", which I've never heard of a group ever doing before.</p>
<p>Christian sums up why  he focuses on matching so much as a technique: "What I like about playing this way, specifically -- and it's changed the way I think and improvise -- we're largely water and electricity, so we tend to take the path of least resistance.  Matching, especially with strangers, eradicates our ruts.  Pea in the pod scenes are not the most <em>fun</em> scenes to be in, but they're challenging because you'll be in someone else's head, making choices you would never have made.</p>
