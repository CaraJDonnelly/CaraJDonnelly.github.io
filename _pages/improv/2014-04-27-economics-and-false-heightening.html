<p>The face of improv in the UK is changing.</p>
<p>Johnstone has taken some stick recently as US-style improv takes root in the UK.  The difference is more or less that Johnstone's style is 'faster' - we learn less about each character, and if you realise that you're doing something 'normal', like painting a fence, you interrupt the the routine: suddenly a lion attacks!  The US-style is slower: why are these two folks building a fence together?  What's happening in <i>their</i> lives?  Funny things can happen, but there's a base of humanity underneath.</p>
<p>But I'll always love Johnstone for the first time I read "<i>Impro: Improvisation and the Theatre":</i> I read in the introduction about a difficult young girl and the nurse that had been assigned to her.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>
"This flower is the most beautiful flower," said the girl, holding it out to the nurse.</p>
<p>"All the flowers are beautiful," said the nurse, <b>blocking her</b>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The emphasis is mine.  It was a long time ago, and it was the first time that I'd grasped that the tools we learn in improv are precisely those facets that <i>lovable people</i> have.  The positivity, the openmindedness, the willingness to drop an idea you really, really liked.  When I'm surrounded by improvisers I can't help but be buoyed up by a group of people whose whole schtick is that they are really happy to see you and that you are each and every one a genius, a poet and an artist.  That passage made me stop, motionless, and think for several hours.</p>
<p>This blogpost is not about that.  Look at the passage again.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>"<b>This flower</b> is the most beautiful flower," said the girl, holding it out to the nurse.</p>
<p>"<b>All the flowers</b> are beautiful," said the nurse, <b>blocking</b> her.</p></blockquote>
<p>This part of the story I only grasped this week.  Think:  What could be in a bottle?  Lots of things!  Wine!  Poison wine!  A note from a castaway!  The elixir of life!  A tiny ship!  A BIG ship!  A shrunken head!  "Answers"!</p>
<p>What could be in two bottles?  Wine and poisoned wine!</p>
<p>...What could be in a thousand?  Wine?  Beer?  Who cares?</p>
<p>If you perform a scene you're not going to use all thousand bottles.  You might use two.  You would <i>definitely</i> explore the possibilities in one.  The rarity of the bottle in the scene makes it more valuable, more interesting, and the way to increase the value of the bottle further is not to <i>add more bottles</i>, but rather to <i>add detail</i> to the bottle you have.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that you should make the bottle the only bottle in the world: it then just becomes "a rare object" rather than "a bottle", and there are lots and lots of rare objects in the world.  Value from rarity, here, isn't monetary, but direct value to people.  A soft toy you've had since childhood; a photograph in your drawer of a happy memory; a wedding ring.  These are the irreplaceable things, and heightening comes from not panning out over a vista of stuff, but zooming in and showing the detail on a single person's face.  It's obvious in retrospect.</p>
<p>(Cross reference:  The noble sacrifice at the end of the action movie, so much more moving than the hundred people killed in the opening sequence.)</p>
