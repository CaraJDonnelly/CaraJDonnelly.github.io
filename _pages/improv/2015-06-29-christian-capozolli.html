<p><a href="http://christiancapozzoli.com/">Christian Capozzoli</a> is an improviser who has studied teaching.  His excellent book, The Aerodynamics of Yes, is available via <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/aerodynamics-of-yes/id580548442?mt=13">iTunes</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aerodynamics-Yes-Christian-Capozzoli-ebook/dp/B00ANZ29KG">Amazon</a>.  Christian was over for a long weekend with C3Something, and helped me clarify and draw firmer connections between several things I had learned from previous teachers.</p>
