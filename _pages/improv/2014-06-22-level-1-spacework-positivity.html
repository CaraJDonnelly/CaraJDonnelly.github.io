<p>Monkey Toast were the first improv lessons I took that were of reasonable length; they weren't an intensive, but were a week-by-week commitment.  I auditioned to get in to Level 2 and skip Level 1, and didn't make it through.  In retrospect, I am happy that it turned out this way.</p>
<p>Monkey Toast Level 1 was taught me by Paul Foxcroft.  There were two classes running in parallel, one taught by Paul and the other by David Shore, and over the course there would be some minor crossover between the two as some people's schedules changed.  Eight weeks, three hours a week, for a total of £200 - or around £8/hour, with lessons in Central London.</p>
<p>It was interesting to be one of the only ones that had ever done improv before, although also to be one of the only ones who was not a professional performer.  Monkey Toast takes care of its students and gives them a gentle introduction to being onstage without a script.  A small part of this course was therefore lost on me, but the overall experience was very positive; suddenly there was someone outside of myself who had an interest in my personal growth as an improviser.  They cleared out some bad habits I had grown; a lot - and I mean <em>a lot</em> of my scenes were conflict driven - and had some excellent exercises I had never seen before, including ones that led the improvisers to be affected by the offers made.  There was a point at the end of the course where <a href="http://www.nextbestthingcomedy.com">Katie Davison</a> and I performed a game-driven scene that avoided false heightening, had solid location and relationship, and came to a satisfying emotional conclusion.  I walked offstage and felt that I had done something I could not have done at the start of the course.</p>
<p>Topics covered:  Positive and clear offers, matching, spacework, status, the game of the scene</p>
