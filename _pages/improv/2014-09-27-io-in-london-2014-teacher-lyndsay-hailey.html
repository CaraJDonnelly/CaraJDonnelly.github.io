<p>Lyndsay Hailey came over to London this September as part of the iO in Europe tour, co-ordinated by the visionary Stefan Pagels Anderson.  Stefan is seeking to bring the iO philosophy - of beautiful scenes and strong connection - to European improv.  It's a noble goal.  Ten different cities in Europe were visited by teachers from iO with each visit involving workshops for the local improv community.</p>
<p>This intensive ran for three days, from the 22nd-24th of September, 2014, in the Nursery Theatre, with Jules Munns being utterly invaluable.  I was organising the London part of the iO in Europe tour, and I learned a lot as a result.  This page will focus on the improv teaching and shows that happened and leave the summary of 'How to Admin' for another time.</p>
<p>My overall impression of Lyndsay's teaching was this: She wanted us to be able to do one emotionally-connected Harold well, and she focused her energies on that goal.  With more time available there would naturally have been more material to cover, and I would be curious to know whether she would broaden her focus to give us more of a smorgasbord of improv to pick and choose from, or whether she would teach us to do one thing well, then another thing well, then... and so on.</p>
<p>It was a good three days.  From Sunday night when I attended the C3467X final of the 5-a-side (featuring Will Hines and <span class="st">Shannon O'Neill) to Wednesday night when I had a rehearsal with the musical improv troupe I'm a member of, I must have seen twelve groups perform and performed with Wolfpack with JR on Monday night.  Going back to work on Thursday was... difficult.</span></p>
