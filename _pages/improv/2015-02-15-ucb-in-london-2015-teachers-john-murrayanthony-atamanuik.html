<p><a href="http://c3something.com/"><em>C3Something</em></a><em> organised <a href="https://www.ucbtheatre.com/">UCB</a> to come over to London to teach us their style of improv.  They ran a full 101 course in a week, which I wasn't able to attend - you can read Steve Roe's <a href="http://hooplaimpro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/things-i-learnt-from-ucb-101-week.html">write-up about that</a> - so I just describe three of the workshops below.</em></p>
<p>I was mildly apprehensive when heading to my first UCB workshop this Monday gone.  London is in an odd state where we get these amazing teachers appear and disappear, and so our improv is informed not just by the schools of Monkey Toast and Hoopla that we have but also by these strong sudden pushes in the direction of one US school's style with the odd consequence that people think of each other and themselves as being more 'iO style' or 'UCB style'.  My last four sudden pushes were TJ and Dave (iO), Lyndsay Hailley (iO), Jet Eveleth (iO) and Tara diFrancisco (iO).</p>
<p>From this odd starting point, and having bought and read the UCB Manual, I was worried that UCB-style would feel clinical and flat to me - all 'base reality' and 'game'.  I was happy to be wrong.</p>
<p>Both John and Anthony got involved in the scenes in the sense of heavy side-coaching: both of them would explicitly spell out what they think was the Game of the scene, and neither of them shied away from language that I had marked in my head as more technical - the most important being 'point of view'.  There's no reason why this should be more technical, although I have always imagined it to be capitalised as Point of View so I remember how important it is.  I would happily study more with either of them.</p>
<p>I took reasonably detailed notes on each of their workshops, and these are available via email  on request.</p>
