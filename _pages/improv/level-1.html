<p>Overall impressions: I had some bad habits that this level drew attention to and started to clean out, specifically <em>positivity</em> and <em>specificity</em>.  I should focus on character; Paul suggested Laban's theory of movement to give me a character with sustained emotions (example: sustained, indirect, forceful could give the movement 'wringing' - play a character who is always wringing their hands.  He suggests that I read Mick Napier's <em>Improvise</em>.</p>
<h2>Lesson 1 (Paul Foxcroft)</h2>
<ul>
<li>More positive offers.  "Spoiling for a rumble" is a less good activity than pickling ginger.</li>
<li>If your scene partner is doing spacework, go out and join them in that spacework.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lesson 2 (David Shore)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Be explicit with your thoughts ("super f***ing clear") - vague spacework is seen as no spacework.  Need to work on starting scenes clearly.</li>
<li>Exercise: Life clock: step through your day one hour at a time, showing how slowly things change.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lesson 3 (Paul Foxcroft)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Everything in life goes into improv.  If there's a cupboard, let it be a cupboard from your memory - it saves on the imagination.</li>
<li>There are essentially two types of game - repetition and acceleration.</li>
<li>Koechnering: repeat the offer your scene partner just made you.</li>
<li>Paul mentions master/servant scenes (a la Jeeves and Wooster) and calls status "the confidence we show the world" and distinguishes it explicitly from rank.</li>
<li>Status fights: make a small movement up or down (affecting yourself rather than your partner - this, I think avoids argument scenes and keeps the conflict abstract).  Four small increments to establish a game, then start going for it.</li>
<li>The scene must continue in order to provide a bedrock to the game.  If the game falters the scene is there to pick up the slack.</li>
<li>Exercise: do spacework without talking about it once - forces the scene to be about the relationship between the two people.</li>
<li>We do three-line scenes, establishing Who, What and Where.  From this point on in Monkey Toast, all lessons begin with three-line scenes as a warmup.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lesson 4 (Paul Foxcroft)</h2>
<p>We do three-line-scene-intros with no impetus other than the previous scene.  It is Move On, the shortform game, and played like this it is the basis of longform improv.  This was an epiphany.  I appreciated the scenes in which we do not discuss spacework.</p>
<ul>
<li>Transit scenes require <em>terrain</em> as their 'where', or people can't enter.</li>
<li>We play "knee-to-knee", telling a story with one person saying "I did this." and the other saying "You did do that, and then you did this.".  "I did do that, and then...".  An exercise in collaoration and specificity.    Specificity in offers makes them easier to repeat and accept.</li>
<li>Repeat names twice as much as other things.  "Treat yourself!"</li>
<li>Paul mentions that tautologies are a game - mentions the UCB mantra "If X, then what is Y?" (time-deadline, space-ruler, entertainment-TV), or (Beaver Vogue, Wolf Hello, Muskrat Time Magazine).</li>
<li>Staring into imaginary vistas is inferior to having good eye contact with your scene partner.</li>
<li>Types of scene endings:  Reincorporate, Agree, Disagree (more difficult), or Paul's invention "repeat phrase slowly".  "I really like bread.  I *really* like bread."</li>
<li>Exercise:  Put all your energy into a door.  Open the door, see what's on the other side.  Forget the door if necessary.  (I think this would be a great way to get around insomnia by triggering a dream.)</li>
<li>4 person scenes:  Each person must enter and exit, one by one, justifying where they're going and why they're coming back (stealing focus for just a moment when they enter).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lesson 5 (Paul Foxcroft)</h2>
<ul>
<li>For each one moment there is one motion (paraphrasing Meisner).  One line, one offer, so your scene partner doesn't get overloaded.</li>
<li>EYE CONTACT with your scene partner is superior to staring into your imaginary place, it keeps you grounded and responsive.  Take things slow, endow the offstage areas ("through THAT door is a kitchen"), and take focus for just a moment on entering to let your scene partners know that you're there.</li>
<li>Find physicality en route to the stage (you have three whole steps to do it in).</li>
<li><strong>Scene audits/3 second pauses</strong>:<br />
AFTER EVERY LINE, ASK THESE QUESTIONS<br />
A) What did I just learn?<br />
B) What did I NOT just learn?<br />
C) How do I move forwards?<br />
Either do A more, or answer one of B.<br />
This made it really easy to Koechner (repeat the thing you just heard, 'A', to show to my scene partner that I've heard and accepted it and that that is the salient thing out of their offer that we are moving forwards with).  Scenes are much calmer, and the performers seem much more confident.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lesson 6 (David Shore)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Even when establishing the Where of the scene, it is vital to connect and interact with your scene partner.</li>
<li>Don't avoid "transaction scenes".  They are fine.  Remember your character knows the other character, and they know you.</li>
<li>Endow the personal history of the other character.</li>
<li>Play at the top of your intelligence.  Don't ever endow someone as having been a rapist, for example.</li>
<li>Again, "one offer, one moment" - if we see one action in beautiful clarity that's better than seeing three things mashed together.</li>
<li>When you establish that characters <strong>believe</strong> a thing, that often means that that thing is not true.  That doesn't mean your character should stop believing that thing - and their holding to that belief can become a game.</li>
<li>We do more 4 person scenes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lesson 7 (Paul Foxcroft)</h2>
<ul>
<li>When doing 'tiny elves' voice them from off - standing upstage from the others and looking away was super-confusing and led to a very stilted scene.</li>
<li>It is fine to keep an initiation for as long as you like, provided you don't plan any further.</li>
<li>We work on supporting a scene with walk-ons.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lesson 8 (Paul Foxcroft)</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is fine and can be helpful to identify the game verbally in your mind.  "If you can, go for it.".  Rest of class was scenework.</li>
</ul>
