<p>Cara started doing improv in 2006 with the <a href="http://www.impronauts.com/">Cambridge Impronauts</a> (then called ICE), and takes every opportunity to study with the exciting teachers that pass through London.Â  If you'd like to be kept up-to-date with her new sets of notes then you can sign up to her email list using the form in the upper-right-hand corner of this page.</p>
