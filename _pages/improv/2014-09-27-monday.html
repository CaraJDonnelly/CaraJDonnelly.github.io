<h1>Morning</h1>
<p>We arrived at the Nursery and Lyndsay began to address the class, explaining that today will be a lot of talking, and that our goal for the course is to be more present and emotionally vulnerable and accept that we as people will make mistakes.  Her love for improv is obvious.  As usual for my notes, all direct quotations are approximate.</p>
<p>"I believe improvisers to be the most evolved people in the human race."</p>
<p>"We can have no judgement in our little-brain parts".</p>
<p><em>Note: Already it should be clear just how striking the iO philosophy is.  It's not unusual for an improv course to start by reassuring the class that mistakes are fine, but it is unusual for a course to start by head-on saying our goal is to be better people.</em></p>
<p>Lyndsay lists the big four 'obvious rules' that she expects we have encountered before:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Yes, and..."</strong> - she comments that this has been evolving as quickly as the art form of improv and that the 'Yes, and...' of thirty years ago is not the 'Yes, and...' of today.  Example:  An improviser initiates a scene by having their character say "Please, let me out of this cage" to another.  Thirty years ago the 'Yes,' would have been for the other improviser to let them out of the cage, whereas today we would understand that the first improviser had some intention in beginning the scene inside a cage.  We can "Yes, and..." in four ways.  I have added my own annotation to the list she gave:
<ul>
<li>Audibly (responding to what they have said)</li>
<li>Emotionally (being affected by their choices)</li>
<li><em>Intentionally </em>(understanding what scene the improviser is offering you and responding appropriately)</li>
<li>Physically (respecting their mimes and the environment they establish)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>No judgement of others.</strong>  Everyone is "a genius, artist and poet".  Everyone is <em>that</em><em> much</em> of a genius, and if we can really, really believe that, then we'll realise that we should shut up when they're talking and really listen to what they have to say.</li>
<li><strong>No judgement of yourself.</strong>  Realise that you belong in the crowd of poets, geniuses and artists.  Allow yourself to go nuts and do that thing you're imagining - it's much easier for a director to pull you back a little than to coax you out of a shell.  "People in this room have paid to say yes to you.  That's not gonna happen that often."</li>
<li><strong>Be present.</strong>    What is important is the here-and-now.  When we describe our immediate plans in an improv scene (and in so describing take control of that scene) the scene becomes <em>boring</em>.  Be present, and you'll develop an instinct for when you're moving with the energy of the scene.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this class we are going to get <em>vulnerable</em> and do a little clownwork.  Things like planning ahead, asking questions, and conflict-heavy scenes are subconscious expressions of our desire to be in control, to know where a scene is going.  Asking a question is a defence mechanism that gives you a knowledge of the next moment - although Lyndsay then points out she doesn't believe in "no fighting", since fighting s a real part of being human.  She quotes "Everything is either f***ing or fighting" - everything is either love-energy or fear-energy.</p>
<p>She moves on to the guidelines she things most important in improv:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Shoot the grandma".  (I'd heard about this guideline from CS and JDg when they did her five-day intensive in Copenhagen) - avoid cycles that do not heighten.</li>
<li>"Often improvisers put emotional weight to something outside a scene.  'I killed your dog' means we aren't present".  The aim is to "hold you in the present tense".</li>
<li>"Today's the day" - give me the most interesting two minutes of these characters lives.</li>
<li>"Know the other characters for six months or more".</li>
<li>The sidelines, the cast that are offstage, are "<strong>protectors of the present tense</strong>" (repeated line).  If two onstage characters are discussing how much of a good time they'll have at prom, the sidelines should call something like "Cut to prom, where we see them fall in love".</li>
<li>3-7-10 is Lyndsay's description of heightening, which she would go on to apply to character, game (<em>see below for a comment on 'game')</em>, group games, beats in a Harold and scenes.  We shouldn't change point of view, but tunnel down with our first idea because we choose to honour our first idea so much we keep doing it to the point where it gets crazy.</li>
<li>"The environment should be used to service the connection".  The sidelines should be reinforcing the scene that is already present and not distracting from it by making unnecessary movements.</li>
</ul>
<p>She moves on to discuss longform openings: the idea that you take from your longform's opening you can use <em>explicitly</em> in your initiation for your first scene, which sets the theme, or thesis, for your longform.  Then everyone - and remember everyone was in that opening, everyone should already be on the same page emotionally - will <em>know</em> they are on the same page and proceed with confidence.</p>
<p><em>Again we see the striking contrast between iO-style and UCB-style improv.  We see in the UCB Manual of Improvisation, p252 (just opposite Del Close's auto-Invocation that I dare not read aloud), they discuss "half-premise initiations" and "premise initiations", where one takes a whole idea for a scene from an initiation and tries to give one's scene partner enough information in the opening to let them and the audience know what the following scene is about to be.  Here we see the beginning of the scene is used to establish an emotional context for the entire piece rather than a 'funny' situation.</em></p>
<p><em>On the same topic, Lyndsay never or rarely used the word 'game'.  If people asked a question about 'game' she responded without drawing attention to it, but she never introduced the idea into the discourse herself.  She quoted Jet Eveleth: "Chase the Gods of Beauty, and let the Gods of Comedy catch up".</em></p>
<p>The morning contained two other exercises.  First, before we even knew each other's names, Lyndsay had us sit in a circle on chairs, and had us go through, one by one, in any order, and say firstly our real names, then tell the most embarrassing story we can think of.  The group then gave us a new joke name based on those stories.  <em>(This actually is kind of a problem for me, since all the embarrassment I had got burned out of me years ago.)</em>  This pushes the group to bond quickly and introduces the idea of vulnerability and acceptance immediately.  I imagine that if this was not an intensive it is an exercise you might place some way into a course to make the group bond, but only after you're sure the students are bedded in properly.  (<em>My name was Brambles.)</em></p>
<p>Second, we pretended to be sheep, dinosaurs and then robots, in the following exercise:  We all twenty of us lay down and slept in the manner of those things.  We then woke, make eye contact with each other as best we could, and tried to find the 'shiniest emotional ball' in the group, joining in an interaction with that person.  Lyndsay has us rerun this several times, pointing out that several times we have discarded an earlier idea rather than stayed with it and heightened it, or that occasionally we have split into several subgroups doing our own things rather than pushing ourselves to be aware of the <em>entire ensemble</em> and being properly connected.</p>
<h1>Afternoon</h1>
<p>We do some various openings (mostly building a noun such as The London Eye, or an aeroplane), with Lyndsay drilling us on emotional listening so that we pick one idea to focus on as we speak as that object - if one part of the London Eye is sad, all of us must be sad.  She repeats 3-7-10 as levels of commitment, and I realise that Invocation openings are heightening in this way as they move from "I see" to "You Are" to "Thou Art" to "I am".  I feel a little silly for not realising this before.  Lyndsay's requirements for something to be labelled a '10' are quite extreme, with the characterisations taken to ridiculous heights.</p>
<p>We play Word-At-A-Time Story, not focusing on the story but instead focusing on the groupmind: if someone descends into guttural noises the rest of the group must descend as well.  We are much more interested in matching characters, emotionally and in their physicality.  It's interesting to watch a teacher drill on a simple game and work particular muscles - and it's good to feel again the difference in improvising when your partner checks in with you with regular eye contact.  I think my onstage eye contact has gotten much better after my improv courses of the previous year, but it would be really nice to be drilled on it by a coach.  I want to try some Meisner, too.</p>
<p>We move from Word-At-A-Time Story to Conducted Story, with Lyndsay pointing, and our eye contact focused on her.  The story I was in turned musical, an improvised version of "In The Navy".  We realise to sing the line "In The Navy" to support my teammates regardless of whether we're being pointed at, and Lyndsay compliments us on ignoring the rules to support the group.</p>
<p>We move from Conducted Story to Story with people speaking when it takes them, and it's visible how much a groupmind has developed over the course of the day.</p>
<p>Closing thought: If you can realise what the obvious thing is and dig into that it and dig enough so that you go through the peak, that is superior to throwing a curveball in the interests of comedy.  Resolve the cadence.  "Use the whole buffalo.".  The artform is still evolving in Europe and in the US - "How many ways can we listen?".  "How many ways can I say yes to this person?".</p>
