<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>We go over the goals of Level 2, a preparatory level that anticipates Harold work in Level 3.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lessons 1-3 will cover exercises for getting out of your head</li>
<li>Lessons 4-5 will cover playing background and tag-outs</li>
<li>Lesson 6 will cover interacting with the audience, including hecklers.  Covering monologues as a source of initiations or a longform.</li>
<li>Lesson 7-8 will cover the 'Commando', a simplified Armando.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lessons 1-3 - Paul Foxcroft, Briony Redman, Paul Foxcroft</h2>
<p>We work on three exercises:</p>
<ul>
<li>Responding without pauses - not responding quickly or rushing speech, but starting to talk without anything in our heads</li>
<li>Matching big characters whilst playing different roles - understanding that this is fun to watch and need not be complicated.</li>
<li>Picking one emotion and playing it over the top</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lesson 4 - Paul Foxcroft</h2>
<ul>
<li>We introduce tags and sweeps - tags to advance the current thread by moving a character around in space or time, and sweeps to change thread.</li>
<li>We want a broad beginning; early on in a longform we want big variety, at least in style</li>
<li>If you think you should edit: edit.  You can always come back to an idea if it deserves it.</li>
<li>Don't swarm scenes with funny flybys (infinite waiter syndrome!) but if you realise you are swarming, swarm more.</li>
<li>Cross upstage and sweep downstage.</li>
<li>Initiating the next scene is the sweeper's responsibility.  If you can't come in for whatever reason, sweep and keep facing the wall.</li>
<li>"If all you do in a show is make one good edit, you've contributed enough."</li>
<li>If you can't follow the sweep and can't get offstage, wait for the initation and match the other improviser.</li>
<li>If everyone is onstage, those without focus have responsibility to edit.  Better to edit from outside a scene.</li>
<li>Not every scene needs a sweep.  But tags count as part of the same scene.</li>
<li>Play background.  Play extras, or objects.  Play symmetry!  It looks nicer.  You get nice *grounding* of a scene - and if you come back, the background can come back too.  By being visually interesting it allows slow stories.  Allows multiple focus, too.</li>
<li>To get a background, you need a where.  Background characters need to be careful of focus, and move slightly slower than they would normally; treat yourself to a big character and just don't make noise.  If you're being an object let your arms be the bit people will interact with.</li>
<li>Foreground characters need to see the background characters but generally not interact.</li>
<li>Tags must be quick and confident or they look awful.  Give a confident initiation, and if you are the continued element in the tag, continue your game.</li>
<li>If you're tagged out as part of a flashback, you might have to tag right back in.  This is not rude.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lesson 5 - Paul Foxcroft</h2>
<p>Missed this lesson, was at the Copenhagen Improv Festival.</p>
<h2>Lesson 6 - Paul Foxcroft</h2>
<ul>
<li>Heckles.  You don't need to respond to them; ask the venue to get involved if it's really bad.</li>
<li>Getting a word: British audiences like to be clever and give you hard words, and you will get the usual dross of 'gynaecologist'.</li>
<li>Keep your intro short, and don't explain structure - would you explain magic tricks before you do them?</li>
<li>Take the first acceptable word.</li>
<li>Monkey Toast form: Downstage front person gets a word, repeats it clearly to the audience, then turns to the rest of the cast, who chorus it as more.  If you don't know the definition, ask immediately.</li>
<li>Monologues: True stories; flawed weird entities with lots of little details.  They don't need a moral, a point on ending; they may not feel entertaining to you.  Share as much or as little as you like; tangents are great but don't ramble on.  Be specific; free associate.</li>
</ul>
<p>(I realised here I could apply Jet Eveleth's idea of balance: I can take from a monologue a vocal initiation or emotive line, a World like 'changing rooms at the swimming pool', or a physical motion of the monologist to find a character; I would use whichever the piece seemed to be missing.  Months later I realised that this was pushing me always to be vocal, something I want to get away from.)</p>
<p>Monologues are non-performative; we become less conscious of our body language as we get caught up in our memories.</p>
<h2>Lesson 7 - Paul Foxcroft</h2>
<ul>
<li>Paul quotes Jill Bernado: "Listen like a thief".  Everything is research.</li>
<li>The Commando: 'Monologue, three scenes, monologue inspired by 3 scenes, 3 scenes...'</li>
<li>This was the first time we were doing any kind of piece; none of our characters had names.  I realise I need to work on trusting my teammates; I owe them my best and that means not rushing on stage but walking on stage when I'm ready.  I take a new motto "I will give you my best".</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lesson 8 - Paul Foxcroft</h2>
<ul>
<li>Balance the speed of a piece: has there been a tag blitz?  Follow it with a scene with none, perhaps a slow and theatrical scene.  We want to have a smorgasboard of ideas to pick from.</li>
<li>If a character is mentioned, wait several beats to enter, so that those onstage can endow you and establish stakes.</li>
<li>When setting up chairs etc. start speaking.  There's no reason to let the energy drop.</li>
<li>"Where else could we take this character?"</li>
</ul>
