<p>"'Bye Mum," called Arijit Douglas, and opened the front door.</p>
<p>"Wait just a minute," she called back. "Don't you want a lift with your cello?"</p>
<p>"No," he said, and shut the door behind him.</p>
<p>Downstairs, he stood on the corner of Fairfield and Bow Roads and checked the time on the scratched screen of his Motorola phone. 14:24, the display read, and his hand trembled. Opposite him stood the Bow Church, built in 1311 by Bishop Baldock. Behind him stood The Glades Apartments, built in 1974 by Southwark Construction Ltd. They suited each other.</p>
<p>He set off down the road, startling a black tomcat in the process. The tomcat spun itself over, as though it had no bones at all, sprinted forwards ten paces, and then turned and hissed at him. It looked for all the world like a little malevolent ghost.</p>
<p>He stopped and stared straight at the cat, which stared straight back. He shook himself. Got to keep walking, he told himself. Got to get to -- he hesitated, then thought -- <em>cello rehearsal</em> -- on time. Never been late to rehearsal yet. He started walking down the slope to Bow Interchange, towards Stratford. His heart was racing slightly, and it was definitely because the cat had startled him. Like a little ghost.</p>
<p>The thing about ghosts, Arijit thought loudly to himself, was that they only ever seemed to hang about in old buildings. He'd never seen any, anyway. He shifted the cello on his back to stop it digging in him. But people died all the time, he thought. So the new buildings should have some ghosts in, at least, and the old buildings should be chokka. But you never heard about any ghosts in the new buildings at all. Maybe fourteen was just too young to have seen any ghosts.</p>
<p>A fat man in a blue jumper was approaching from the other direction, pouring a small bag of chips into his mouth. Was he watching Arijit? Arijit's palms were a bit sweaty from where they were holding his cello straps. Maybe the fat man was a ghost. The fat man caught Arijit staring. He was so surprised he choked on his chips and started coughing loudly as he walked past, his face red with embarrassment and chips. Arijit jerked his eyes to the front and failed to suppress a mad giggle. Last rehearsal today. Last. Rehearsal. Today. Think about something else. Think about ghosts.</p>
<p>Arijit and his Mum had only rented that flat for two years, so they had no idea who’d died there before. So maybe two years wasn’t enough time to notice a ghost. Maybe you had to be in a place every day, for a long time, like a priest is, if you want to notice them. Maybe just no-one had died.</p>
<p>That thought struck him as hilarious. Maybe no-one had died. He giggled again, a little nervous. It didn’t seem likely -- flats just seem like the kind of places people die in. Maybe, thought Arijit. you could only see ghosts when you were afraid of them, late at night. Maybe it's fear.</p>
<p>He arrived at the rehearsal spot at 14:40, far too early. It wasn’t far away from home: five minutes down the road, under the flyover and onto the Greenway, the little patch of grass near the A11. Today they were rehearsing, he reminded himself, in the spot where the real performance would be. There were baffles set up in a rough semicircle and four chairs set up in front of the baffles. Jackie, Amelia and Muhammad drifted in over the next quarter of an hour. Together, they set up for a piano quartet, with keyboard, violin, oboe and cello. It was a school group but the schools had given them the instruments to keep. Everyone was taking a lot of care.</p>
<p>“Last rehearsal,” he said, too loudly. Amelia smiled back at him, her jaw just a little tense.</p>
<p>Ghosts, he thought firmly. You had to be paying attention to see them, or they’d slip past. Better start paying attention. He started tuning his cello, slowly twisting the stuck pegs. He had broken one of them last week, and had had to fix it with superglue before Mrs Arnolds had noticed. You couldn't see the join unless you were looking for it.</p>
<p>The wind was blowing from the Stratford Olympic Village to the North. If he breathed in deep it smelt a little bit like shit, but only a little bit. The openings to the sewers around there were round, grated manholes that don’t keep in the smell. The sky is grey, but wasn’t going to rain on their instruments, Google had said earlier. The wind was a bit chilly and the smell not nice. It was good.</p>
<p>“Last rehearsal,” he whispered to his strings. A man walked past with his hair all standing on end. The only sounds are the rumbling of the wind and the gentle rushing of the cars on the nearby A-road.</p>
<p>The four of them sit down. He closed his eyes and tuned out the world, playing pizzicato with his left hand while everyone warms up. This is my last chance, Arijit thinks. Last chance to get things right before the show. They finish warming up.</p>
<p>They began to play one full run-through. The piece was Gilbert and Sullivan’s "At The Outset I May Mention" from the Grand Duke, which Mrs Arnolds had picked for them. The cello line had a nice repeating counterpoint to the violin. They were going too quick on the beat, so he slowed down. His friends were following his rhythm.</p>
<p>His eyes still shut, he smelled cigarette smoke. He opened his eyes again and found he could only focus on his stringboard. He closed them again. He could still smell cigarette smoke. He giggled nervously. It must be a ghost . He imagined the ghost of a woman in smart shoes clopping down the Greenway. She would stop to smoke and listen to them play. He could see in his mind's eye her grey shirt and fashionable mobile phone. No-one alive would ever stop here, he told himself, because of the smell. He imagined her clopping off away down the path, and breathed out again.</p>
<p>He was playing too fast again, so he slowed down again. He focused on breathing in and out once per bar in time with the thrumming of his strings. When they had an audience for real, next week, he reminded himself, he’d have to play louder. He should play louder now, just to practise, he told himself, and he pressed harder with his bow. He heard Jackie draw harder on her violin. Then Muhammad played louder and firmer, then Amelia, everyone together playing louder and firmer. They reached the beginning of the end. Jackie’s violin sang the soprano part</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Opoponax! Opoponax! Opoponax! Eloia!</em></p>
<p>and he grinned as his cello replied with the tenor part</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Opoponax! Opoponax! Opoponax! Eloia!</em></p>
<p>and the four of them played the final notes in synchrony</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>El-loi-a-a!</em></p>
<p>and he opened his eyes to see the crowd of Mum and Uncle Bert and Mrs Arnolds and Sandra from next door and Jackie’s Mum waving her cigarettes and grinning and Muhammad’s Mum and Dad and Amelia’s brothers and realised he was crying a little and you could just see the sun through the clouds and it had gone okay.</p>
<p>It had gone okay!</p>
<p>Performing was <em>brilliant</em>.</p>
