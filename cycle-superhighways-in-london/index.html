<p>The following map overlay shows the current <strong>and proposed</strong> <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/routes-and-maps/cycle-superhighways">Cycle Superhighways in London</a> as of Jan 2018, similar to <a href="http://www.opencyclemap.org/">OpenCycleMap</a>.  Cycle Superhighways are new cycle routes, around half of which are physically separated from traffic by a kerb or by another barrier.  I compiled this overlay because it took me around three hours to work out how to cycle to work and I wanted it to be more generally available.  The routes are as accurate as I could make them, which is to say, <strong>approximate</strong>.  Do not use this map to navigate.  Cycling in London kills around 14 people each year.</p>

<p>It's mighty weird that in 2018 TFL invites you to send off for a free paper guide to cycling in London rather than making the information directly accessible so navigation apps can use it.  I understand that making these maps is hard -- so why push it on to us cyclists?</p>
