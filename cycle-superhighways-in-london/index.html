<p>The following map overlay shows the current <strong>and proposed</strong> <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/routes-and-maps/cycle-superhighways">Cycle Superhighways in London</a> and the <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/routes-and-maps/quietways">Cycling Quietway</a> that together make up the <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/improvements-and-projects/central-london-cycling-grid">Central London Cycling Grid</a> as of Apr 2019.  This map has an intention similar to that of <a href="http://www.opencyclemap.org/">OpenCycleMap</a>.  Cycle Superhighways are cycle routes, around half of which are physically separated from traffic by a kerb or by another barrier; Quietways are quieter roads.  I compiled this overlay because it took me around three hours to work out how to cycle to work and I wanted it to be more generally available.  The routes are <strong>approximate</strong>; sometimes Google Maps didn't let me plot a cycle route going the "wrong way" down a one-way road for motor vehicles.  Do not use this map to navigate.  Cycling in London kills around 14 people each year.</p>

<p>It's unacceptable that in 2019 TFL invites you to send off for a free paper guide to cycling in London rather than making the information directly accessible so navigation apps can use it.  I understand that making these maps is hard -- so why push it on to us cyclists?</p>
