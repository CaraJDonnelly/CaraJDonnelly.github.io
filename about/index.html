</i><i>While you're <b>t</b>hinking <b>o</b>f <b>a</b> <b>d</b>ifferent <b>world<br />
</b>Then you might see me waiting on the corner<br />
Staring through you in your different world</i></p></blockquote>

<h2>Ethics</h2>

<p>Cara Donnelly believes that technology can be used for the public good.  She is therefore a member of bodies that work to that end.  Because working towards the public good requires collaboration and common ground, she does not maintain a separate, personal code of ethics.  She works as a Site Reliability Engineer.</p>
