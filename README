This document should convince you that using Jekyll for this project was the
wrong idea.  It should then convince you that it was the least-wrong idea.

This blog focuses on /posts/ and /stories/.  When we display stories we want to
display things like chapters and subchapters in order, and when we display the
top level page of stories we want to display a fully expanded list of all
stories, chapters and subchapters, all in order.  For legacy reasons we would
also like the URLs to remain what they were when this blog was hosted on
Wordpress, i.e. a directory-based format.

We achieve this with Jekyll by using a combination of collections and static
pages.

Take the story GENERIC_STORY.  It has two chapters, 1 and 2, each with three
and four subchapters respectively.  For the third subchapter of the second
chapter you create a static HTML file at

/stories/GENERIC_STORY/CHAPTER_TWO/SUBCHAPTER_THREE/index.html

and edit

/_STORIES/GENERIC_STORY.html

to provide the ordering in the story, the previous and next buttons, etc.

Each subchapter should have the layout of 'subchapter'.  This will display
navigation for within the story.

All of this takes a little while to render because each subchapter needs to
find itself in the stories collection, and there is some mildly unsettling
repetition in the story ids, chapter ids, subchapter ids and the directory
paths.  But this is the main selling point of Jekyll: do the horrible
computation once.
