Hi!

These are some Christmas stories I've written.  Before you read further...

...you'll notice there are more than one, and they have names that are uuids.
This is because my friends are a varied set and I wanted to write stories that
might mean something to them.  But...

...I'd ask you, if you're received a link to a story like this from me in a
Christmas email card, please don't read all of them.  I'd rather you talked
about them with each other, and  the story I sent you was one I thought about
you when writing, and the other stories are gifts for other people.  You
wouldn't peek at the wrapped gifts I have on my shelf, right?

A few more rules:

* At least one file in this directory isn't real -- it was generated by a
  Markov chain.

* I tried to spend the same amount of time /per capita/ on each story -- so
  some people might get a rougher story but one which I sent to fewer people.

* No story went to just one person.

Happy Christmas!
