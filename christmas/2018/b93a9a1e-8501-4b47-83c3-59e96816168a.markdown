Happy Christmas, and happy new year!

# Quiet Cataclysm

The Millery Cross didn't deserve its name; three roads and a footpath that scuffed its way to a statue's arse.  Mag made a conscious point of circling the statue to see its front, which commemorated the divine reign of George IV.  She nodded and walked on, fiddling with the single hair chop holding back her ponytail.  It was somewhere near.

Millery was a straight line, as far as she could tell.  The one road was a mix of houses and shops, broken by shards of scruffy grass, windows either dark and shuttered or boarded up with rainbow-coloured planks.  She caught herself smiling at the bright colours and instead made another conscious point, this time to frown at the inequality of the silence of the town with bright-lit Bellby, where even now, on the second day of December, there would be open shops with lamps in their windows.  Yes, it was somewhere near.

The day's light was leaving, and a light rain starting to fall.  She breathed in the town once more.  Earth, grass, beer, and the other thing.  Breating in the evening air she was Mag Wren, or even just *herself*, no name, a person walking by a roadside.  No name, and no honorific.

Certainly not Mag Wren, the Quaker Vampire Hunter.

----

The Dying Shrub smelled less of beer than the roadside, which surpriseed her.  She opened her journal and made a note to ask about that, then made a further note about the statue, and George IV's divine reign, then one about the tension between letting inequality overwhelm a community vs recognizing it as inequality, and then one final note about main trade routes making themselves bigger over time.

"Want your pigeon pie with gravy?" asked the barman with the ash on his breath.  She nodded.  "Cheesy chips for three pounds extra?"  She shook her head and smiled a thank-you.  He nodded back and stepped out of sight into the Dying Shrub's kitchen.  Mag sipped her tapwater and breathed in.  Beer (but less strongly than outside!), leather from the chairs, smoke from the barman's cigarettes, varish from the bartop, and the other thing.  A stool scraped beside her and the world was replaced with the smell of sweat.  She opened her eyes.

"Save your soul for a tenner, save your life for fifteen?"

The man now sat too close to her was covered in stains: beer stains on his shirtfront, seat stains under his arms, and -- worryingly -- blood stains on his shirt cuffs.  She edged back slightly, then leaned backwards further still.  She could see the barman's apron peppeing out the door, and while it had twitched when the sweaty man had spoken to her, he hadn't run out to protect his customer.  She started breathing again, and immediately wished she hadn't.  He *stank*.

"Save your life for a tenner?"

She frowned.  Maybe it was time to leave.  She started counting out payment for the pie.

"I thought you said fifteen," she said, by way of pasing the time.  He grinned hopefully.

"That's right, fifteen.  Save your soul for ten."

She blinked, tired, and glanced at the notes in her hand.  "I've only got five, and --"

"Done," and a note vanished from her hand and into his pocket.

"Firstly, are you --"

"Leave her be, Hisk."

The new speaker had been sat at a table nearby, and now raised a hand to Mag in greeting.  His hair was strawberry blond and his eyes were sea green.  Mag raised her hand in greeting as well, and started when the sweaty man, Hisk, grabbed it and shook it.

"Eliot Hisk," he rasped, still grinning, his palm hot and soft.  The redheaded man, seeing he'd had no effect, rose to shake her hand as well, and after Hisk's hand his hand was pleasantly cool and defined.  The readheaded man gave a short bow.

"Richard Barton," he said.  "Brewmaster."

"Mag Wren," she replied, and repeated herself a few times so as not to be called "Magwryn," which happened quite often.  Mag looked Welsh enough for it to be a believable name for her, though "Magwryn" wasn't a nae as far as she knew.  Mag was Cornish, anyway.

The barman came back with her pie, and she carried it to a table.  Sweaty Hisk followed her and Barton followed him, and she was too tired to shoo them away.  Besides, Hisk had promised to save her soul.  The barman -- John -- brought her cutlery and a gravy boat.

Hisk thumped a worn-out Bible on the table and opened it on its broken spine to the blank page between the New and Old Testaments.  He ran his finger down some pencil, notes, then jabbed it toward her.

"Have you, Mag Wren, lived a good life?" and he jabbed his finger toward her again to punctuate the question.  She shrugged.

"I hope so."

"Have you ever been arrested?"

"Yes."

Hisk paused, and after a moment Barton raised his eyebrows.  Mag met their gaze levelly, and Hisk continued.

"Do you believe in monsters, Mag Wren?"

Firmer ground. "No."

Hisk smirked.  He looked genuinely happy and still sweat was running down his dark hairs and falling in droplets onto the pub table.  "One more question," he murmured.  "Do you believe in God?"

Mag sighed inwardly.  Was this a day whose name was red or green in journal.  "Yes," she lied -- although either answer would have been a lie of sorts.  Hisk was laughing a raspy laugh and Barton was smiling.

"So," she said.  "Were you saving my life or my soul?"

"Your soul, Ms. Wren -- and I'll tell ye to pray from now until ye die, for you aint pure enough to escape and aint evil enough to live.  This town is owned by the monster called the Vampire King."

Mag had silently taken out her journal and now flipped it to today.  One good thought.  She thought of the rain on the road outside, and started doodling a sentence in Gothic script.  Her pie had been nice too, but she thought that tomorrow might be less nice and so put her journal away instead.

Hisk and Barton were still waiting for her reaction.  Might as well be honest.

"I don't believe in monsters."

Barton grinned and Hisk leered.  "Well," Hisk said, "for ten pounds more I'll drive you to the next town.  It's ride or die, lass."

"I can't leave yet," she replied, then, eyeing Hisk, added "and I don't have ten more pounds.  I'm here to save aall of your lives."

---

The church hall was ordinarily locked on Sunday -- in fact, had been locked for several months after the pastor had vanished, presumed either dead or fled.  It smelled of stale cake sales and hot yoga musk: sweet, wistful aspirations now gone.

It had been easier than Mag had expected to gather the townsfolk, in part because there were so few of them left: Hisk, Barton and Black, the barman, and with them Davies, the baker, Macpherson, the handyman, and O'Brien, the librarian and now the town clerk.  She climbed on a dusty milk crate anyway.

"There's a vampire here," she said, simply.  "If you stay here past tomorrow, you will be dead be the end of next week."

"No such thing as vampires," said Macpherson.  But he didn't look surprised, and he didn't turn to leave.

"There is a vampire -- I've seen it!"  Hisk shouted.  Mag winced.  The hall wa not full enough to warrant a shout.  Barton shook his head at Hisk's claim.

"You'll die because I'm here," continued Mag, as if neither of them had spoken.  "Even the weakest vampire wants to feed once a month, and when they move on to find a new nest they eat a much larger meal for the journey.  That means three or four of you at least.  So if I can persuade even two of you to come with me tomorrow morning, the vampire will hunt immediately tomorrow night and everyone else will die."

"How is it that you claim to know so much about vampires?" Barton asked.

"They..." Mag hesitated.  "They call me a vampire hunter."  Not a lie, and the scars on her neck were a reminder that there were no simple truths. "But I don't believe in monsters." Barton raised his eyebrows and the room exchanged glances.  Davies spoke from by the slatted window.

"You ever killed a vampire?"

"Yes," said Mag, and she -- 

--*flinched away from her brother's face as he lunged, the curious dry feel of his pale skin, the stab of pain as one of her hair chops splintered against his ribs and his mouth gaped*--

"...kill this one?" Davies had continued.  She hadn't heard the full question.

"No," she replied, anyway, staring at the wooden sprung floor.  "I'm a Quaker.  I'm not killing anyone." She breathed in -- *her brother's dry skin, flaking away* -- the hall's stale air.  "I help you leave, that's all."

"Vampires can eat animals," said Barton, "in every story I've ever read.  What good will running do if it can follow us?  Better surely to stay here and fight."

Mag shrugged, and her shoulders ached from shrugging so many times before.  "You can't make me fight, or teach you to fight.  I can't make you leave your homes.  But if any two of you choose to come, the rest of you will have chosen to die."

"What kind of choice is that?" Macpherson spat.  "And vampires aren't real!"

"It's an nasty choice," agreed Mag.  "I can protect you as you leave, or you can stay here, and even if you all choose to stay with six of you the vampire will need to move on after two more months anyway."

Macpherson's answer was to stalk out into the night, and slam the door behind him.  There was a moment of tense silence.

"Mairi, his wife," O'Brien murmered.  "He insists she ran away."  He shrugged.  It was a theme of the evening.  A moment later he sighed.  "I was planning to leave next week anyway.  My bags are packed and I was waiting for the end of the month to record any new... events.  What should we do?"

"We should stay here tonight.  I'll ward the hall.  In the morning it'll be safe to move, and full daylight is at --" Mag checked the back of her pocketbook "-- eight twenty-three.  So we'll meet back here at eleven thirty and head out of town together.  As soon as we move the vampire might choose to attack, and the vampire can probably travel under a heavy coat around this time of year."

"By  car, it will --" Mag stopped.  Someone had coughed.

It was O'Brien.  "We've no cars; after Alfred, our mechanic, left, they've eventually all broken down."

"I can fetch the supply truck," said Hisk, his eyes gleaming.  "In Ballytullough, the truck that brings in food."

Mag looked at her map.  "That's fifteen miles," she pointed out.  If you jog there in three hours, take an hour to borrow the truck, half an hour to drive back, an hour for me to ward it, we can set off at two in the afternoon.  So everyone else pack and we'll wait for you here."

There was a ripple of glances throughout the room.  Black, the barman, spoke first.

"If we end up on foot and not setting off from here until two, we'll never make it to Ballytullough before dark."  He glowered, then added "assuming any of us can afford the toll for riding the truck."

Hisk's lazy smile confirmed that there would indeed be a foll for riding the supply truck.  "We'll need the supply truck anyway," he said, "for Mac's maw Ellie.  She can't walk a mile.  How's this: I walk to Ballytullough now, before the vampire knows we're leaving, and drive off at first light.

"Drive *back* at first light," Mag corrected, and the room rippled again in hostile agreement.

"I'll go with him," said Barton suddenly.  "Make sure we get back on time."  To Hisk, he added "and two men would be safer than one."

It was reluctantly agreed, and sweaty Hisk and quiet Barton set out into the night.  Mag set to warding the door against vampires.

---

The corpse twitched, and Mag yelped in fear.

"It's me!" cried Barton.  "It's just me!"  His normally pale features were ruddy and dominated by a vicious bruise that covered the entire left side of his face; by a miracle of the cold night it had barely begun to swell.

Mag had literally stumbled across him in the dawn air as she unsealed the church hall.  He whimpered and shook, then flung himself into the sanctity of the disused church hall with an anguished cry.  Words spilled out of him in a rush.

"We got to the bend by the drop and... the vampire attacked Hisk.  He... died.  I... My face got hit, and then I ran.  It's a... an astonishment I'm not dead."  The men from the village gathered around him while Mag stood in the doorway, feeling the Sun's first rays of the day.

"We walk," she said.  "And we'll need to carry Ellie Macpherson.  No bags; nothing but food and money.  We can come back when we have transportation."  She frowned, then, feeling her frown, stepped over to the hall sink and began her flask.  She hummed a low melody as the water swirled.

"What's that you're working on?" Barton demanded.  "Holy water?"

"We should leave Ellie behind," said O'Brien.  "Come back for her tomorrow."

Mag caught herself smiling at Barton.  "Holy water, yes," she replied, then "We're not leaving anyone behind.  I'll protect all of you or none of you."

"And how will you protect all of us?" Barton spat.

"With my holy water," she replied, waving her flask and notebook at him, "and my holy words."

---

It was an hour after dark that the vampire attacked the group.

Macpherson and Black were carrying Ellie Macpherson by turns, and O'Brien and Davies walked alongside, each with a rucksack of money, food and water.  Barton had set off ahead "to scout" he had said, and Mag had let him go with her flask of water in his coat pocket.  She was following, dropping seven-knotted hairs and handkerchiefs soaked with a mix of her blood and cocaine, then circling back to keep watch.  Neither would work, really; hair magic mostly affected witches, and vampires tracked by both sound and smell.  The blood-and-cocaine handerchiefs would deaden the vampire's sense of smell, but only if it were stupid enough to pick one up and smell it.

So it was a pleasant surprise when Barton stepped out of the trees and inhaled one of the handkerchiefs deeply.  He then blinked, and sniffed the night air, confused.  Mag spoke to him from the trees.

"Cocaine.  In the second world war Danish fishermen used it to smuggle Jews out of Denmark, by deadening the noses of the dogs they brought as trackers."

Barton whirled around to face in her general direction, but could not find her in the trees.  "I don't need scent to hunt, child."  He reared his pale neck and swung his head slowly around, pointing his ears in all directions.  Any noise, no matter how small, would reveal even the most experienced of vampire hunters.

But Mag Wren was a Quaker.

No-one can be quiet like a Quaker.

The peace of the forest road surrounded them.

Barton snarled and turned toward the convoy slowly walking ahead of them.  He bared his teeth, now fangs.  Mag chose her words carefully.

"If you attacked them, I would have a perfect opportunity to kill you."  A truth.

"You would, and you would not take it."  Barton flexed his shoulders, looking less human by the moment.  "Vampries can taste truth, Mag Wren, and you were telling it earlier when you said you weren't going to kill anyone.  The only time you lied was when you claimed to believe in God -- and you and I know there is no God on this Earth."

"Perhaps I'll injure you," she replied, echoing her voice through the trees.  "It's happened before."  Truth.

"How will you do that," Barton asked, "without your precious holy water?"  He held her flask aloft and carefully poured it into dust.  He flexed his claws and turned once more to the convoy, now a little ways up the road.  The lights of Ballytullough were just visible in the distance.  She spoke in desperation, still careful to tell the truth.

"Perhaps my book of holy words would help me," and she opened the spine with a dramatic *crack*.  Too late, she realized her error.

Barton moved faster than she could follow and at once was cradling her neck in his claws.  "I shall take that," he hissed, and her notebook, the sound of which had led him to her, was gone from her hands.  As if in sympathy, the heavens opened and it started to rain.

"I see you, still," she said, and he wavered.  "Richard Barton.  You ran the brewery here.  Your family have been here generations, you told me.  Whatever happened to change you was not your fault."  His eyes were now shut tight.  "I still see you."

Barton flung her and she hit a yew tree with all the force of a vampire's throw.  Her head swam and she saw a shape shuffle toward the convoy.  "Richard Barton is dead," it said.

"You're weak," she said.  "When you broke my ward at the church hall to escape from the Sun it hurt you.  Four men on their guard is more than you've ever faced before."  The vampire's movements visibly firmer and more decisive, and it kept moving toward the convoy.  She swallowed, her heart aching.  "I don't want you to read my notebook."  The rain fell heavy on her through the yew tree branches.  "I don't want you to learn its deadly truth."

Barton staggered, still weakened from the night's exertions, and turned on her for the last time.  "I shall use your deadly truth first to kill you, then the food shuffling away, then all of Ballytullough.  I shall *feast*."

"I don't want you to read it," she said.  Truth.  "Only a killer could use it today."

And the rain fell down on Mag Wren and on who had once been called Richard Barton as he opened her notebook to the note she had made last night in the pub over dinner.  It read:

<img src="/images/2019-Q1/all_water_is_holy_water.jpg" alt="a page of a notebook, mostly blank, with Gothic script in the middle that reads 'All water is holy water'" />

and the rain fell down on Richard Barton, a vampire who can taste truth, knowing the divine rain that falls on kings and commoners alike, and Richard Barton burned in holy fire.

The men from the convoy, seeing the light, returned.  They found her sat in front of a circle of ash.  The rain ran down her hair, and her face was dry.

"I suppose you believe in monsters now," O'Brien muttered.  Mag's eyes flashed in the darkness.

"I did when you suggested leaving an elderly woman behind to be eaten by a vampire," she said, and burst into tears.

---

They caught up with her the next morning as she was waiting for the bus back to Bellby.

"Thank you for saving our lives," said O'Brien, sincerely.  Black nodded.  There was a long, painful silence, then Mag spoke.

"I didn't make Richard Barton a vampire.  I didn't kill the people he killed.  If I'd known what to say to him, I think I could have saved his life too.  But I didn't know.  So I couldn't save him."

The bus arrived, and Mag picked up her rucksack, her flask and rain-soaked notebook inside.  Black frowned, then called after her.

"Wait -- you never told us your name.  Who are you?"

Of course -- Barton and Hisk had known, and they were both dead.  Mag looked back at them standing on the roadside.  She shrugged.

"I'm just a Friend."
