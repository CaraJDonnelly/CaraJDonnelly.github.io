Happy Christmas!

For my card for y'all this year I have taken the drawings I made in 2018 and coloured them in.
Each one taught me a little something.

From the [Alternative Comedy Memorial Society](https://noblefailure.org) I learned that I should go to more live comedy in London, and that for the purposes of photography, a comedy show is probably "in public":

From chess.com I learned that I can learn chess without the ridiculous learning curve.  Thanks chess.com!  Here's a checkmate:

From a little gig in Camden I learned I love live music enough that I should go to more gigs by default:

From rearranging my flat I learned technical drawing skills are still useful to work out where to put a bookcase, 20 years on:

From `Hole`, by Ellie Kendrick, I learned you *can* cover a leotard in shards of mirror to make the most amazing costume ever:

**Happy Christmas** and good luck in the New Year, y'all!
