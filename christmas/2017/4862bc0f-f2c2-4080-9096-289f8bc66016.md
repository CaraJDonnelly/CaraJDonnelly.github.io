**Content notice:** terrorism, death.


We look like fish.

You might think a spooked crowd would run all at once -- simultaneously -- but physics tells us that this is not possible -- nothing happens simultaneously -- or you might think people would start to run in a shockwave that travels at the speed of sound -- everyone runs when they hear the sound of Astraeus starting to scream or the start of an explosion -- spooks each of us in turn as individuals -- no-one is an individual -- or you might realise we see others turn to run and turn to run ourselves.  We are social animals, even in space.

Erigeneia sees herself in the glass at the end of hallway 15A -- the Station hallways are broad -- there are many people -- the hallway was designed with this in mind, a running crowd -- this isn’t unexpected, this isn’t a crisis come out of nowhere, this was foreseen, this is OK -- this is bad, this is bad and it was foreseen, bad things happen all the time, reality is bad -- and she keeps running toward her reflection.  Her reflection is familiar -- familiar is good -- we are social animals, like electrons jostling in a solar wind -- like a crowd -- easier to scare than an individual -- starting to run sooner than an individual would alone.

She turns the corner -- the hallway is still 15A, it bends -- you might think a crowd starts to run like a shockwave travelling at the speed of light -- everyone deciding to run when they see the hole in the hull, plus a few milliseconds thinking time each -- and you remember Olber’s paradox, and its resolution -- you know that light doesn’t pass through a crowd smoothly -- unless they are a crowd of ghosts -- Erigeneia swung her arms and breathed in and out in rhythm with the closing blast doors behind her -- gift still in her left hand -- people get in the way -- the people stand in between you and the device as it flashes red and so the shockwave of fear moves slower -- sparse crowds let you see the fear hit people twenty metres ahead -- human reaction time is 250ms for visual stimuli -- fear shockwave spreads at 20 metres/250ms or 80 metres per second -- faster since recognizing when to run will be an optimized pathway in our brains -- in a heavy crowd you can see only half a metre ahead, fear travels at 2 metres per second -- how fast can people run?  Erigeneia counts her breaths, counts her steps, counts her heart rate.

Othrys Station is only seven years old, built or rebuilt for the Olympic Games at Tau Ceti.  The announcement was the posh Dutch woman who does all of the ship safety announcements.  Erigeneia ran past the lit red signage that the announcer’s voice echoed.

"This is a public safety announcement:

"Move away from this area.

"Move away from this area.

"Move away from this area."

The Sipylos Concourse at that time contained perhaps three hundred people -- living people at that time -- all staring towards the disturbed area -- Erigeneia looks at her running feet and adds gift-buying back on to her to-do list -- all Stations have such things, just not Othrys Station -- unkind to bomb a jewelry shop before she bought Astraeus’s present -- Astraeus had screamed -- run, run, run, Erigeneia hears -- her own voice, in her head -- no time for other voices.

She had seen someone 30 metres away turn to run -- then she had turned to run -- speed of fear was 120 metres per second -- human sprint world record for 100 metres is 10 seconds, so 10 metres per second -- 5 metres per second, people weren’t sprinters -- so fear moved much faster than the crowd -- so she remembers only very small amounts of turbulence -- a large man wanted to pass her, or perhaps she him, or perhaps they both wanted to pass a couple with a pushchair -- everyone running for their lives, all running at the same speed.  You’d need -- feet running, someone fallen down -- you mustn’t help others during an attack -- more bombs to target the helpful -- maybe visibility of 2 metres to get a crush from a spooked crowd -- four person per four metres squared to block it off -- one person per metre squared to make a crush.  Not much.

Erigeneia runs into an office complex -- past a group of people crying -- two of them kissing -- and crouches by a hoarding -- looks down, black hair falls forward -- hard to see in the low light settings the Station has for the evening -- nightwatchman wants them to leave, they’re crying -- they leave -- he locks the gate -- walks straight past Erigeneia to back inside -- the shoulder-sirens of the Astynomia have started droning -- the police are barking orders.  

Erigeneia opens her clenched fist.  Wound around the little finger of her right hand was a cord, and on the end of the cord was a clear glass Christmas bauble.  Inside the clear glass was a holo of a blue-green star.  As Erigeneia watches, the star collapses inward and went nova.  The holo starts again, on a loop.  Astraeus would have loved it.  He found tacky things hilarious.  Again and again, the starlight flickers out, leaving only the dark and the noise.

We look like fish -- mortal.
