blurb: "Dave Lister has woken up from Better Than Life and found his body wasted away.  Now he's back to reality, what is there for him?"
---
Dave Lister sat in the Stellar Observation Deck.  Well, he lay there.

He had assked Kryten to move him up there from the MediLab, and Kryten had obliged with such a happy smile that Dave frowned, although he didn't know why.

Maybe the stars would tell him.

"You there, Dad?" he whispered.  **Better Than Life**, the addictive videogame that granted your every wish, had left his body wasted to the point of collapse; a drip stand to his left fed him a low-dosage but steady inflow of painkillers.  It still hurt to breathe.

Dave Lister's dad, of course, was Dave Lister -- he was the Ouroborous, the last human being alive; a time loop that oscillated backwards and forwards but never quite died.  He was humanity's last gasp -- a lager swilling Scouse who was in search of Earth and happiness but who would settle for a vindaloo.  Or a Shami Kebab.  That was Dave Lister's dad -- Dave Lister.

But Dave Lister's Dad -- with a capital 'D' -- was the bloke who had found him in a box under the table in the Aighburth Arms and taken him home to the missus.  Who does that?  Who takes a baby home?  You'd ask behind the bar first.

Lister's eyes filmed over with salt water, a bit.  It was the pain.  It wasn't thinking about his Dad -- he'd passed on when he was six.  Football scores down the toilet pan.  All that palaver with the school headshrink.  It was the pain, and not the memories.  He looked hard at the stars, and thought of something else.

He thought of Bert, the policeman -- the cop -- in Bedford Falls, or the imaginary Bedford Falls that **Better Than Life** had made as a trap for him.  Bert had always been looking out for people, and every night -- *every night* -- Lister had been able to help him a little.  Every night, Bert had been struggling with something and Lister had helped him out.  Bert when he was unstuck could get a drunk out of the drunk-tank, or get a cat out of a tree, or get Peter to the hospital having started the squad-car with a paperclip.  Bert was someone he could help.

Lister looked at the stars.  They probably looked back.  Given how friendly the rest of the Universe seemed, they probably looked back and salivated.

He blinked, and blinking hurt.  He frowned, deliberately, and frowning hurt.  Kryten had told him to exercise a bit each day.  "You'll be right as rain, sir, and twice as stylish!" Kryten had announced to the Medibay. The Cat had groaned from the next bunk.  Anyone that thought Kryten knew what style was was drunk, or stupid, or both.  The chirpy Mechanoid's head could be used to iron a bra -- and that was as far as his style went.  Practical, not stylish.  Lister stopped frowning, and relaxing his face muscles was a different kind of pain.  But Kryten had been trying to help.  Had helped.  Was helping.

Lister wasn't religious. Not really.  He'd met Jim Bexley Speed of the Zero Gee Football London Jets once; he'd surivived the rest of humanity by about three million years; he'd had a perfect kebab one night in Liverpool. Still, he wasn't *that* lucky, not lucky enough that he believed in some kind of celestial being.  He'd lost Krissie.  He'd people.  He'd lost...

...well, everyone.  Petersen.  Selby.  Chen.  Frankenstein.  Everyone, really.

Lister had lost his Dad when he was six.  It was a really, really, really, really, really long time ago, even counting for the fact that he'd been in stasis for three million years.  So it was weird that his Dad was sort of bothering him.  Just recently.  Not like a *ghost* or anything, he wasn't *mental*, but something like that, like a *ghost* or something.  Like his Dad used to make him wash his hands after playing with Plasticine even when he hid his hands behind his back.  Like his Dad knew something that Dave didn't, and Dave didn't know how.

Dave started out at the stars.  Maybe they looked back.  It was a big Universe.

They passed an hour together, Dave and the Universe. Maybe.  Dave fell asleep a few times and each time he woke up his shoulder ached and his bladder felt like it was trying to kill him.  Maybe it was more than a few times.

Bert.  Bert was the cop, the policeman, from Bedford Falls, the fake world that **Better Than Life** had made for Lister.  Always in trouble, always trying to help.  And Dave always helped, didn't he?  Except...

...it wasn't really *help*.

**Better Than Life** had been just that.  Better.  Better than Life.  **Better Than Life**.  Whoever you were, it scanned your brain, and it brought your deepest, darkest, truest desires to life for you, and then it kept you there until your body starved away to nothing.

Bert hadn't been real.  Bert, who had been fake, had been trying to rush Peter, who was fake, to the hospital, which was also fake.  There, the fake doctors who had fake degrees could stabilise fake Peter's fake stroke for his fake family.

He'd felt like he'd helped someone that day.  His kidney twinged.  Maybe.  Lister hadn't really paid attention in Biology, so maybe it was his iver.  Something hurt, anyway.

He hadn't really helped Bert.  He'd spent years, real years, in a videogame helping someone whose only purpose was to -- helping some **computer programme** that was programmed to sucker him in -- when he could have been...

...what?

Dave drifted in the Universe for a while.  He stared at the Universe, and it stared back.  Maybe.

Dave had lost count of the planets and moons and ships they'd met.  All they life they'd met had been some bit of humanity that had been left on the kitchen counter overnight and gone a bit fuzzy in the warm.  Agnoids, GELFs, GELF-offspring like the Polymorph, Rimmerworld.  But they were three million years away from Earth still.  For humanity's scraps to have spread out this far meant all of it must have got pretty far, like how vindaloo sauce on the pavement always spread much further than the big chunks you'd thrown up.  So when you saw the sauce, you knew there'd be chunks soon.

Dave wondered if his Dad had used to vomit on pavements, before he'd found Dave in a box under the pool table at the Aighburth Arms.  Probably not.  But maybe.

"Sorry, Dad," Lister whispered.  Just to be on the safe side.  But he'd done alright, hadn't he?  Lived to three million.  How many people could say that?  Not many, he bet.  Left the Solar System.  How many people could say that?  Not many, he bet.  And he'd got his plan.  He'd got Kryters, and his Cat.  And even Rimmer.

He fell asleep again.  The stars watched him sleep.  Maybe.

Kryten checked Mr Lister's pulse.  A mere formality -- the stretcher unit was wired up to the ship's alarms and would have alerted him if anything had gone wrong.  Still, pressing his thick rubberized fingers against Mr Lister's neck gave him a sensation he was never quite able to express to himself of how real Mr Lister was.  Kryten supposed this was just his code having gone completely and dangerously corrupt after three million years of loneliness, and put it firmly out of his mind.

"Come on now, Mr Lister," he cooed, hoisting the stretcher unit in one hand.  "Let's get you back to bed."

Mr Lister sighed in his sleep.  Kryten squeezed his hand, and Mr Lister, still asleep, squeezed his hand back.  Kryten blinked, pleased, and took both himself and Mr Lister back inside.

*Happy Christmas 2019, and happy 2020!*
