Hi!

This directory has some are some Christmas stories I've written.  It's
possible, maybe a bit difficult, to find all of them and read them.  But before
you read further...

...you'll notice I've said there's more than one.  This is because my friends
are a varied set and I wanted to write stories that might mean something to
them.  But...

...I'd ask you, if you're received a link to a story like this from me in a
Christmas email card, please don't read all of them.  The story I sent you was
one I thought you would like, and the other stories are my cards to other
people.  You wouldn't like them as much.

I tried to spend the same amount of time /per capita/ on each story -- so some
people might get a rougher story but one which I sent to fewer people.  No
story went to just one person.

Happy Christmas!
