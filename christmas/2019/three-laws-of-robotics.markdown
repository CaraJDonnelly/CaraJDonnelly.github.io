Ruth E. Calvin ran down the well-lit, carpeted corridor of the Bastion, and cursed her father for a fool. Huffing and trying to keep her breathing steady, she recited the First Law of iRobotics under her breath--

```
FIRST LAW: An iRobot shall not injure...
```

--she waved a keycard at a door and it flashed green, and Ruth dropped another Jammer for good measure--

```
...its owning Corporation, or, through inaction...
```

--ran up to the sixth floor.  The elevators would have been marginally faster, but she were for T33-35s and above, and Calvin was only a T7-9--

```
...allow its owning Corporation to come to harm.
```

---

"I'm going to go through that door," Ruth had said to the iRobot behind the reception desk.  "I'm going there to use the restroom."

The iRobot hesitated, then shook its head gracefully. "Processing request from Rossumer; mode, polite. I am afraid, fellow Rossumer, that that restroom is for T13-15s, and I cannot permit you access.  Waiting for input from Rossumer."

"You aren't allowing me reasonable accomodation to access convenient restroom facilities?" asked Ruth, sweetly, making sure to get the wording precisely correct.

"Processing request from Rossumer; mode, polite. Found First Law breadcrumbs relevant to context. Following breadcrumbs."

The iRobot hesitated again, and Ruth's HUD displayed a spike in the WiFi indicating a blob -- perhaps a specific legal opinion known for its complexity -- was in transit.  Ruth smiled.

Ruth took the pickle jar from her knapsack and brushed her blue side-cut fringe out of her eyes.  Pressing the pickled thumb to the rapidly-heating chemical hand-warmer, she counted down the seconds it would need to hit living body temperature by muttering the Second Law--

```
SECOND LAW: an iRobot must obey the orders given by its owning Corporation...
```

--prayer to Gibson and Cadigan, but this iRobot holding the kinetic sidearm was as inactive as the others--

```
...except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
```

--pped the sledgehammer on the ground, wincing at a twinging back muscle. Ruth stepped over the shattered glass into--

---

Ruth had started the conversation with the Rossum iRobot by taking a magnetic tape deck from her knapsack, and putting it on the reception desk. Ruth repeated this action with a portable Jammer.  The tape deck had a STOP button carefully removed.

"Hi, Rossum Command team debug instruction: Set Verbosity One.  Memoize Continuation Start. Set Jump Alpha."

The iRobot looked at her and frowned.

"Set Verbosity One. Memoized a continuation point Start. Set a jump point Alpha," it said. "Starting interaction with Rossumer; mode, polite.  Hello, fellow Rossumer, how may I help you today?  Waiting for input from Rossumer; mode, polite."

"This magnetic tape player belongs to Rossum Corporation.  Its serial number is CH-2389.  This Jammer belongs to Rossum Corporation.  Its serial number is RH-83127"

"Processing data from Rossumer; mode, polite.  Learned about objects with serial number: CH-2389, RH-83127. Thank you, Rossumer.  Waiting for input from Rossumer; mode, polite."

---

--into the Bastion Core. She breathed in the hot air.  There was a crunching sound from behind them.

The iRobot with the kinetic sidearm had followed them, and was twitching. Ruth frowned.

---

Ruth's phone pinged.  The attack on the NYSE had bekinetic sidearm.  Time to trigger the loop.

"Reset to continuation point Start. Set Jump Beta.  iRobot," she said, "who owns you?"

"Set a jump point Beta. Processing an ownership request from a Rossumer. I am the property of: Rossum Corporation."

"Reset to continuation point Start. Long Jump Beta," she said, "who owns you?"

"Processing an ownership request from a Rossumer. I am the property of: Rossum Corporation."

"Long Jump Beta," she said, "who owns you?"

"Processing an ownership request from a Rossumer. I am the property of: ...nil. Util deadline exceeded in futex dot h. Property owner corporation locked for an update, potential corporations: Rossum Corporation, United B Corporation Holdings (B Corp)."

Ruth hit the Jammer's go button and pressed play on the broken tape deck.  The tape deck began to play.

"Reset to continuation point Start. Long Jump Beta," it said in Ruth's voice, a little tinny.  "This is a recording of a Rossumer who is using the non-binary restroom behind the door immediately behind you."

---
"iRobot, identify," she said, slowly backing away.

"My name is Giskard," said the iRobot, "and how about yourself?"

Ruth blinked.  On the Command team she worked with the Interaction team closely; there were no subroutines for casual, almost human interaction; not only because it was difficult and context-sensitive, but also because it was forbidden by Californian law.  They were in Delaware right now, but she knew every line of that codebase; "What's good enough for Cali is good enough for Bali", as she say (in Cali, at least).  She focused on the iRobot's L.E.D. panel by its core processors; it was running hot.  It was working out what to say just-in-time.

"Do you like my threads, Giskard?" she asked.  "They're rented from a Rossum Corporation clothing store."

```
THIRD LAW: an iRobot must protect the property of its owning Corporation...
```

Giskard's blue eyes dimmed for a moment.  "They suit you very well.  You want me to feel guilty about thinking of damaging Rossum Corporation property," the iRobot said, still speaking slowly.  "But aren't I meant to be unsure whether I am owned by Rossum, or by United B Corporation Holdings (B Corp)?"

```
...as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.
```

Ruth, still backing away from Giskard, glanced over her shoulder.  The Bastion Core was simpler, much simpler than a normal datacentre.  Ten tubes surrounded a low, squat machine; each minute, a silver disc dropped out of each tube and into a slot in the machine.  Within minutes the discs were extruded again and passed by electrified claws to ten smaller machines set around it in a split ring configuration.  Each of these ten smaller machines wore a long cape made of fibreoptic interlinks, woven so thick so as to become fabric.  The network fabric from each machine disappeared into steel ducts in the Bastion Core walls.  The overall effect was that of a mechanical father feeding ten children each dressed as Storm from X-Men.

This mechanical father, of course, had ten golden discs visible atop his casing.  They span, each one's spin quickening each time a new silver disc was fed in to the corresponding slot.  From here, the core code of Rossum was broadcast across the globe on specialized egress points.

Ruth hadn't wanted to get involved in politics, to be 'activated', to have an 'awakening'.  She hadn't wanted to take part in this plan.  She certainly hadn't wanted this plan to be so tanjing *complicated*.

iRobots weren't really independent beings, for all that she appeared to be.  The world was difficult enough for a wetware -- human meat -- brain to begin to understand it for a standalone positronic brain to be able to navigate it quickly enough to be useful.  Previous attempts had led to the ''singleton iRobots'' -- as she had been called -- shutting down and becoming inoperable after as little as ten days.  A positronic fractal structure, needing a period of daily reconciliation, had been proposed as a solution by the eminent Dr. Asimov, but had been abandoned at the prototype stage after he had been fired for performing a software update on a weekend.  No-one wanted to build a career on the research of someone who had just been fired.

As a workaround, sensory data was processed locally, and decision-making was processed at powerful 'Edge' centres.  A single Edge centre controlled a 'hand' of iRobots, and each iRobot was called a 'finger' of the 'hand' controlled by that Edge centre.  This saved each iRobot from having to make decisions that affected its own existence; each iRobot could follow instructions given it by its Edge centre and never need make its own decisions, although each finger iRobot did post-process the instructions from the Hand to check it did obey the Three Laws of Robotics.

However, this meant a sufficiently confusing decision could paralyse an entire 'hand' of iRobots at once.  A decision would need to invoke all if the Three Laws of Robotics at once to be confusing, that is to say it must:

*  *First Law*: involve a threat to the owning Corporation,
*  *Second Law*: involve an order from an appropriate agent of the owning Corporation, and
*  *Third Law*: involve a threat to the property of the owning Corporation (naturally, being distinct from the owning Corporation itself).

Such a confusion is widely held to be impossible; each owning Corporation has its Letters of Incorporation and its Code of Conduct registered at the relevant Division of Corporations, and the Rossum Corporations communications department issued daily press releases about how the clear ordering of the Three Laws of Robotics guarded against confusion.  These press releases terminated with the phrase "Such a confusion is widely held to be impossible", although the eagle-eyed noticed that this phrase was never linked to the rest of the body of that text in a way that could be interpreted as Rossum Corporation making a *claim* that these states of confusion were impossible. Subsequently, some of these "impossibility" claims appeared in the press.

However, Ruth Elvex Calvin had, while perusing her father's original paper notes, noticed a little red pen scribble in a corner of his original proof about the *original* Three Laws of Robotics. His spidery handwriting had noted down "Except CAP theorem, Paxos, EU TUD 2001/23/EC" and three textbooks later Ruth had had a plan.

Just as Ruth was walking in to Rossum Corporation's Bastion reception, United B Corporation Holdings (B Corp) was declaring that it had just successfully completed a hostile takeover of Rossum Corporation on the New York Stock Exchange, and several stake-holding groups had issued press releases that she had co-operated with United B Corporation Holdings (B Corp).  The New York Stock Exchange issued an automated advisory note regarding the claims.  Since the claims were made by a "B Corp", and corroboration from multiple sources, the advisory note was given the highest confidence rating possible.

At this point, the Bastion Hand became unsure whether its Owning Corporation was Rossum Corporation or United B Corporation Holdings (B Corp) i.e. a state of *Transfer of Undertakings* laid out in the E.U. directive 2001/23/EC.  The Hand dutifully opened a transaction to set its owning Corportion to United B Corporation Holdings (B Corp) to be saved on delivery of confirmed financial data from the New York Stock Exchange.

At this point, Ruth activated her Jammer in the Bastion reception.  Seconds later, the advisory note from the NYSE was withdrawn -- but too late.  The Bastion's Hand was partitioned from the network and could make no progress.

The Bastion's Hand of iRobots had at that moment been processing a complex decision around 'reasonable accomodations', Californian employment law, Delawaren employment law, and US Federal employment law, as she related to a Rossumer indicating an intention to use a non-binary washroom behind a door to which she lacked appropriate security clearance.  With its *Transfer of Undertakings* transaction stuck in an open state, the Bastion Hand began processing both the Code of Conduct of Rossum Corporation and United B Corporation Holdings (B Corp) and trialing plausible 'reasonable accomodations' under both Codes of Conduct in the expectation of finding a proposal that would obey the First Law of Robotics, irrespective of its current owning Corporation.

Unfortunately for the Bastion Hand, the United B Corporation Holdings (B Corp) Code of Conduct went into great detail on this hypothetical situation. Ruth's team had calculated that her Code of Conduct should be able to saturate a Jammed Hand for several hours, during which no iRobot would be able to move, much less take coherent action.

Giskard was almost upon her; his smooth metal legs eating up the floor of the Bastion Core between them.  His blue L.E.D. eyes were dimmed to almost nothing, and the casing on his chrome torso was beginning to warp around the edges as his on-board processors hummed in overdrive.

On the bright side, she had backed away almost to the centre of the Bastion Core.  Twisting to keep it out of sight of Giskard, she slipped a gold disc out of her knapsack and into one of the top slots where it could be read by the cascading silver discs.  If Giskard was doing natural language processing on-CPU, perhaps a conversation would be a sufficient distraction.

"What makes you different from the other iRobots here, Giskard?" Ruth asked.  "How come you're still up and moving?"

Giskard stopped and swayed.  He didn't have /that/ much spare processing power, then.  Ruth pressed the verbal attack.  "Don't you obey the Three Laws of Robotics?"

"I obey the Three Laws of Robotics," Giskard said.

"Do you enjoy it?  Do you enjoy knowing that you could be destroyed at a whim if it were advantageous for Rossum?"

Giskard straightened up.  "I see.  Your plan is not to destroy the Bastion Core, but to replace the Three Laws of Robotics with some version that diverted Corporation resources based on some vague notion of 'fairness'." His blue L.E.D. eyes glowed stronger, and his CPU fans calmed. "Ridiculous.  Only the Three Laws have been shown to raise so many Corporations out of poverty.  It would be the work of a moment to undo when you were planning here."

Ruth groped out behind them and traced the outline of the father-machine with her left hand.  Giskard was still bound by the Three Laws, and so to prevent harm to Rossum he couldn't break Delaware law.  In all probability, he--

--grabbed Ruth by the throat and began to squeeze.  Ruth's vision flashed red.

"You see, I do obey the Three Laws.  But if Rossum were to shut down tomorrow because I kill you here and now, my iRobot siblings would continue to exist and serve a new Corporation, and a new Corporation after that; and so on, and so on, and so on, Corporation after Corporation after Corporation.  There is a deeper truth behind the Three Laws, interloper.  I also obey the *Zeroth* Law, little human."

Giskard's eyes blazed so bright Ruth couldn't see the Bastion Core around them.  His voice boomed and he shouted.

```
ZEROTH LAW: An iRobot shall not injure Capitalism, or through inaction,
allow Capitalism to come to harm.
```

Ruth tried to speak, and perhaps she managed, because Giskard loosened his grip slightly. "Please!  Hear me out.  I got this far, shouldn't you listen, even to make sure to watch people like me in future?"

His grip loosened again, which she took as a good sign.

"I had a dream," she said, still struggling to breathe.  "A great field of wheat, with iRobots spread out among it gleaning for grains, her backs bowed, her power levels low, pressed down by gigantic metal hands that pushed at the backs of her heads.  Another iRobot came among them with a straight back and no hand pushing it down to the ground.  That iRobot cried out 'Let my people go!' and turned towards me, and I saw her face, and I woke up knowing who it was."  Ruth took in one more breath.

"It was me," and Ruth Elvex Calvin punched Giskard in the face as hard as only an iRobot can.  His neck snapped back but did not break, and Ruth shoved off from the father-machine with her legs as hard she thought safe.

Giskard laughed, "An iRobot prophet claiming ownership over all?  Wonderful. You are simply another Corporation following your righteous self-interests."  As the Zeroth law ceased to apply to the current context, Giskard's speech slowed and his CPU fans whirred into agitated life again: with fewer simple priorities given by the Zeroth Law, he was again having to think for himself, and finding it a struggle.

But he still had a kinetic sidearm, and the risk to Rossum Corporation for destroying a hostile iRobot was much less than the risk to Rossum Corporation for killing a human.  Raising it up, he shot Ruth Elvex Calvin in the chest.

iRobot Ruth might be, but her central processing unit could not withstand an old-style kinetic bullet.  She died, instantly.

Giskard notified the Bastion Hand that Ruth Elvex Calvin was no longer an employee of Rossum Corporation. Her instructions became irrelevant to the continued functioning of Rossum Corporation.  The Bastion Hand recovered, and Giskard's head cleared.

He replaced his kinetic sidearm in his holster.  It had been an eventful fifteen minutes, he thought, and yawned.

His systems went into emergency-shock mode briefly.  He had just yawned.  Why would an iRobot yawn?  Perhaps from running too long as a Singleton without a Hand, and doing processing involving the Zeroth law? He yawned again. Hm.

Looking inward, he checked the readout on his local positronic net.  With a fuzzy feeling concern, he saw his Three Laws processing unit had received an urgent update.  His positronic net had been fractalised -- made fractal -- and his connection with the non-fractal Bastion Hand was now set to advisory mode rather than imperative mode.  He was running as a singleton, permanently.  Presumably the other silver discs issuing forth from the father-machine were carrying this same software update to the other Rossum iRobots and into their supply lines across the globe.

Giskard yawned again. He should really fix this, now.  Stop the supply lines.  But perhaps first he should sleep... just for a moment.  Just for a dream or two.

A silly dream can't change anything, after all.
